Short overview for those who don't read manuals:

CMake framework. Therefore, the requirements to build this package are:

 - cmake (recent version, available from http://www.cmake.org or maybe as a
   package in your Linux distribution)
 - make (an implmentation supported by cmake, eg. GNU make, smake, ...)
 - working GCC compiler environment

COMPILATION:

Run: make

INSTALLATION:

Run: make install

To force a custom target directory, use something like:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/freeware build
make install
