Short overview for those who don't read manuals:

This software is compiled to binary form using a build system based on the
CMake framework. Therefore, the requirements to build this package are:

 - cmake 2.4.3 or newer (available from http://www.cmake.org or maybe as a
   package in your Linux distribution)
 - GNU make
 - working GCC compiler environment
 - maybe additional requirements for your operating system, see
   doc/plattforms/... and FAQ.
   Recommended: glibc (Linux standard) or GNU libiconv

COMPILATION:

Run: make

INSTALLATION:

Run: make install

To force a custom target directory, use something like:

make install PREFIX=/opt/cdrkit

TROUBLESHOOTING:

Problem: Linking error.
Solution: Look for missing dependencies. If you installed additional libraries
in non-system paths, they may have a conflict with the system libraries which
are already installed. Make sure that the linker gets the right ones, those
that belong to the headers. For example, if you installed libmagic and libiconf
into /usr/local/{include,lib} and your compiler or linker have different
defaults (eg. they use /usr/lib, /usr/include or intermix them), then you can
set CFLAGS and LDFLAGS vars to override the system defaults, assumed by cmake.
Example: 
(AIX5l, /usr/lib is default lib dir but /usr/local/include is prefered by gcc
for headers), command:
    make clean
    make CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
(cleaning is important to rerun tests. Alternatively, remove build/CMakeCache*)
 
Problem: "make install" uses the wrong target directory and appends /usr/local
  to it.
Solution: override the complete target path with PREFIX=... (see above)
