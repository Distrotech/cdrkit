Icedax User guide
=================

NOTE: expressions in angle braces have to be substituted with
      the corresponding numerical values.
      For example: <delay in seconds> has to be substituted
	with the numerical value to be used.

Common tasks
============
NOTE: The examples used here depend on proper default settings for interface
method and devices as specified in the Makefile. They can be overriden with
command line parameters, but here I choose to focus on simple examples. 

Copy complete audio CDs

1. Copy an audio CD into wav files one per track.

	icedax -B

   will produce the sample wav files (one per track)
	audio_01.wav
	audio_02.wav
	...

   and the corresponding description files
	audio_01.inf
	audio_02.inf
	...

2. Same as above but include MD-5 type signatures

	icedax -B -M<length>


3. Same as above but use other file name ('party_cd.wav')

	icedax -B -M<length> party_cd.wav


Copy single tracks

1. Copy one track (eg track 6) into a wav file.

	icedax -t6

   will produce a wav file including track 6

	audio.wav

   and

	audio.inf


Copy parts of tracks

1. Copy from given start time to end of track

	icedax -t6 -o<delay in 1/75 seconds>

   will record track 6 starting at track time <delay>/75 seconds
   from track beginning upto the end of track.

2. Copy from given start time and record for a given time

	icedax -t6 -o<delay in 1/75 seconds> -d<time to record in seconds>

   will record track 6 starting at track time <delay>/75 seconds
   from track beginning for <time to record in seconds> seconds.



Copy tracks into a pipe

	icedax -t6 -Oraw - | audio_compressor

   will feed the audio samples (in big endian format) of track 6
   into a secondary program audio_compressor.
(See also script cdda2mp3(.new) for a suggestion, how to process all tracks of
an audio cd with a MPEG-Layer3 encoder (not included here).)


Miscellaneous

1. Use icedax as a cd player

	icedax -eN -t6

   will copy the audio samples into a sound card (if sound card support
   is compiled in) and will not write any file.



2. Get complete information on the cd

	icedax -v63 -Nd0.01

   will try to find out a media catalog number and track related
   information (ISRCs) in addition to indices. For CD-Extra discs
   limited support exists to retrieve additional information.
