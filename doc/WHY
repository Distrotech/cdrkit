Why cdrkit? Why wodim? Why genisoimage? Because:

 - it won't tell you that you have no /dev/pg* device file thing foo, that you
   have never seen and you will never need
 
 - it won't require to be executed as root, fail with obscure messages without
   such permissions

 - it won't force you to wait 3 seconds every time you want to start, no matter
   what you specify as gracetime=
 
 - it won't kill another burning process when you do -scanbus in another shell

 - it will let you specify your device directly in the way you know it, rather
   than forcing some weird TARGET,BUS,LUN syntax with weird numbers
 
 - it will not wreak random havoc if you used spaces and not tabs in the config file

 - genisoimage won't stop accepting the well known option -L in the near future

 - genisoimage will stop on 2.1GiB large files rather than just "forgetting"
   them and let you burn crap
 
 - users are respected and not used as pinballs between us and the OS kernel
   developers
