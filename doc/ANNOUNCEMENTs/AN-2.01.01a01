Please have a look at the German open Source Center BerliOS at www.berlios.de
BerliOS will continue to support free hosting of cryptography projects even
when US laws change and don't allow to host cryptography projects in the USA.
Also look at sourcewell.berlios.de, the first Open Source announcement service
that itself is implemented as Open Source project.

NEW features of cdrtools-2.01.01a01:

*******
NOTE: this is _not_ a release that starts a new aplha/beta series of dirtibutions.
	The only reason is to add certain new CD/DVD features that are important.

	So _please_ do not send any patches except when you like to fix extreme bugs.
	I am currently mainly working on stable incremental restore featurs for star-1.5-final.
	Once star-1.5-final is out, cdrtools will start a new developent cycle.
*******

-	Better lint make rules

-	Better autoconf rrules for ACLs

Mkisofs (By Jörg Schilling and James Pearson j.pearson@ge.ucl.ac.uk):

TODO:
	-	read Joliet filenames with multi-session if no TRANS.TBL
		or RR is present. I am looking for a volouteer for this task!

		Note that this can never be 100% correct as there is no relation
		between the names on the master (UNIX) filesystem, the ISO-9660
		names and the Joliet names. Only the Rock Ridge names are
		untranslated with respect to the original files on the
		master (UNIX) filesystem.

	-	add libecc/edc for CDI and similar.


CYGWIN NT-4.0 NOTES:

To compile on Cygwin32, get Cygwin and install it.
For more information read README.win32

The files are located on:

ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/cdrecord/alpha ...

NOTE:	These tar archives are 100% POSIX compatible. GNU tar may get some
	minor trouble. If you like a 100% POSIX compliant tar, get star from
	ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/star/

WARNING: Do not use 'winzip' to extract the tar file!
	Winzip cannot extract symbolic links correctly.
