Wodim and genisoimage allow you to create multi-session CD's with all
supported drives.

According to www.cd-info.com, a CD+ is a CD with two sessions.
The first session is an audio session, the second session a data
session.

Creating a CD+ is first writing an audio session in 
multi session mode and then writing a data session.

If you like to append a filesystem to a audio CD, first extract the 
CD by calling:

	icedax -B -vall

This first audio session may be written in TAO mode with the command

	wodim -multi -audio file1 ....

or in DAO mode with the command

	wodim -dao -multi -useinfo -audio file1 ....

To add the second session that contains the data track, you need
to create an ISO-9660 file system that starts not at sector 0.

With the current genisoimage, you must use the following method:

-	First call wodim -msinfo for your prepared multi-session audio CD.

	you will get something like 0,12345

-	Now call genisoimage:

	genisoimage -o fs.raw -C 0,12345 root_directory_for_new_cd

	replace 0,12345 with your actual wodim -msinfo output.

the image in fs.raw may now be written with wodim as second session.

See my README.multi for more info on how to create multi session CD's


The procedure again in short form:

	icedax -vall -B

	wodim -multi -audio audio_tracks ....
or
	wodim -dao -useinfo -multi -audio audio_tracks ....

	wodim -msinfo ....
	(output is e.g. 0,12345)

	genisoimage -R -o cd_plus.raw -C 0,12345 root_dir_of_fs

	wodim -data cd_plus.raw
or
	wodim -multi cd_plus.raw


Note: If you want to create an HFS hybrid as the data track, then you must
use the '-part' option to genisoimage. Otherwise, the data track will be mounted
as an ISO9660/Joliet CD when used on a Mac.
