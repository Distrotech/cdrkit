This describes the program as shipped with cdrkit, a spinoff from the
cdrtools project. However, the cdrtools developers are no longer
involved in the development of this spinoff and therefore shall not
be made responsible for any problem caused by it. Do not try to get
support for this program by contacting the original authors.
