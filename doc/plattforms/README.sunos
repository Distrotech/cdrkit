Cdrkit have been built and partially tested on SunOS 5.8.

To compile, run "gmake". CMake must be installed (with its modules), the cmake
binary must available in your path. Installing GNU libiconv is also recommended.

On linking problems with 3rd-party libraries involved, make sure that you have
matching configuration of CFLAGS and LDFLAGS vars.
