Forking cdrtools as cdrkit
--------------------------


So, why the fork? CD/DVD burning is a complicated business that needs a
lot of knowledge, so forking such a big collection isn't a light
step. It needs a lot of human resources that could better do something
else.

That in mind we (Debian maintainers) did have a good and working
relationship with cdrtools upstream Jörg Schilling for the past few
years. It did work well, in both directions, Jörg even commented on
Debian bugreports, which is one of the best steps any upstream can
do. Of course we had some discussions over the years, but thats normal.


Unfortunately SUN then developped the CDDL[1], a license that was
intentionally made incompatible to the GPL.  The FSF itself says that
this is the case and also people who helped drafting the CDDL state
it. We had two (one former) Sun employees visiting us at our yearly
Debian Conference, 2006 in Mexico, and there Danese Cooper clearly said
that the CDDL was modelled with the MPL in mind to achieve the
incompatibility with the GPL. For everyone who wants to hear this, we
have videos from that talk available at [2].


You can read the FSF position about the CDDL at [3] and some statements
Debian people brought up at [4] and a wide range of other mails in that
thread.  Basically the CDDL has extra restrictions, something thats not
allowed from the GPL.  As Jörg has a different opinion about this and
repeatedly stated that the CDDL is not incompatible, interpreting the
look of a face in the mentioned video, calling us liar and generally
seemed to be unwilling to consider our concerns (he never replied to the
parts where we explained why it is incompatible), so basically ignoring
what we said - we had no other choice than a fork.


We used the last version where the program code was licensed under GPL
and killed the incompatibly licensed build-system. It is now replaced by
a cmake system, and the whole source we distribute should be free of
other incompatibilities, as to the best of our current knowledge.


Anyone who wants to help with this fork, which especially includes other
distributions, is welcome to join our efforts. You can contact us on
IRC, server irc.oftc.net, channel #debburn or via mail at
debburn-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org, our svn repository is
