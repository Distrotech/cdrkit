.SH NAME
genisoimage \- create ISO9660/Joliet/HFS filesystem with optional Rock Ridge attributes
.\" ----------------------------------------
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B genisoimage
.RI [ options ]
.RB [ \-o
.IR filename ]
.IR pathspec " [" "pathspec ..." ]
.\" ----------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B genisoimage
is a pre-mastering program to generate ISO9660/Joliet/HFS hybrid
filesystems.
.PP
.B genisoimage
is capable of generating the 
.B System Use Sharing Protocol records (SUSP)
specified by the
.BR "Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol" .
This is used to further describe the
files in the ISO9660 filesystem to a Unix host, and provides information such
as long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, symbolic links, and
block and character device files.
.PP
If Joliet or HFS hybrid command line options are specified, 
.B genisoimage
will create the additional filesystem metadata needed for Joliet or HFS.
Otherwise
.B genisoimage
will generate a pure ISO9660 filesystem.
.PP
.B genisoimage
can generate a 
.I true
(or
.IR shared )
HFS hybrid filesystem. The same files are seen as HFS files when
accessed from a Macintosh and as ISO9660 files when accessed from other 
machines. HFS stands for
.I Hierarchical File System
and is the native filesystem used on Macintosh computers.
.PP
As an alternative,
.B genisoimage
can generate the
.I Apple Extensions to ISO9660
for each file. These extensions provide each file with CREATOR, TYPE and
certain Finder flags when accessed from a Macintosh. See the
.B HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS
section below.
.PP
.B genisoimage
takes a snapshot of a given directory tree, and generates a
binary image which will correspond to an ISO9660 and/or HFS filesystem when
written to a block device.
.PP
Each file written to the ISO9660 filesystem must have a filename in the 8.3
format (up to 8 characters, period, up to 3 characters, all uppercase), even
if Rock Ridge is in use.  This filename is used on systems that are not able
to make use of the Rock Ridge extensions (such as MS-DOS), and each filename
in each directory must be different from the other filenames in the same
directory.
.B genisoimage
generally tries to form correct names by forcing the Unix filename to
uppercase and truncating as required, but often this yields unsatisfactory
results when the truncated names are not all unique.
.B genisoimage
assigns weightings to each filename, and if two names that are otherwise the
same are found, the name with the lower priority is renamed to include a
3-digit number (guaranteed to be unique).  For example, the two files
.I foo.bar
and
.I foo.bar.~1~
could be rendered as
.I FOO.BAR;1
and
.IR FOO000.BAR;1 .
.PP
When used with various HFS options,
.B genisoimage
will attempt to recognise files stored in a number of Apple/Unix file formats
and will copy the data and resource forks as well as any
relevant Finder information. See the
.B HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS
section below for more about formats
.B genisoimage
supports.
.PP
Note that
.B genisoimage
is not designed to communicate with the writer directly.  Most writers
have proprietary command sets which vary from one manufacturer to
another, and you need a specialized tool to actually burn the disc.
.B wodim
is one such tool.  The latest version of
.B wodim
is available from
.IR http://www.cdrkit.org/ .
.PP
.B pathspec
is the path of the directory tree to be copied into the ISO9660 filesystem.
Multiple paths can be specified, and
.B genisoimage
will merge the files found in all of the specified path components to
form the filesystem image.
.PP
If the option
.B \-graft\-points
has been specified, it is possible to graft the paths at points other
than the root directory, and it is possible to graft files or
directories onto the cdrom image with names different than what they
have in the source filesystem.  This is easiest to illustrate with a
couple of examples.  Let's start by assuming that a local file
.I ../old.lis
exists, and you wish to include it in the cdrom image.
.IP
foo/bar/=../old.lis
.PP
will include
.I old.lis
in the cdrom image at
.IR /foo/bar/old.lis ,
while
.IP
foo/bar/xxx=../old.lis
.PP
will include 
.I old.lis
in the cdrom image at
.IR /foo/bar/xxx .
The same sort of syntax can be used with directories as well.
.B genisoimage
will create any directories required such that the graft
points exist on the cdrom image \(em the directories do not need to
appear in one of the paths.  By default, any directories that are created on 
the fly like this will have permissions 0555 and appear to be owned by the
person running
.BR genisoimage .
If you wish other permissions or owners of
the intermediate directories, see
.BR \-uid ", " \-gid ", " \-dir\-mode ", " \-file\-mode " and " \-new\-dir\-mode .
.PP
.B genisoimage
will also run on Windows machines when compiled with Cygnus' cygwin
(available from
.IR http://www.cygwin.com/ ).
Therefore most references in this man page to
.I Unix
can be replaced with
.IR Win32 .
.\" ----------------------------------------
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Several options can be specified as defaults in a
.I .genisoimagerc
configuration file, as well as on the command line.  If a parameter is
specified in both places, the setting from the command line is used.
For details on the format and possible locations of this file, see
.BR genisoimagerc (5).
.TP
.BI \-abstract " file"
Specifies the abstract filename.  There is space for 37 characters.
Equivalent to
.B ABST
in the
.I .genisoimagerc
file.
.TP
.BI \-A " application_id"
Specifies a text string that will be written into the volume header.
This should describe the application that will be on the disc.  There
is space for 128 characters.  Equivalent to
.B APPI
in the
.I .genisoimagerc
file.
.TP
.B \-allow\-limited\-size
When processing files larger than 2GiB which cannot be easily represented in
ISO9660, add them with a shrunk visible file size to ISO9660 and with the
correct visible file size to the UDF system. The result is an inconsistent
filesystem and users need to make sure that they really use UDF rather than
ISO9660 driver to read a such disk. Implies enabling
.BR \-udf.
.TP
.B \-allow\-leading\-dots
.TP
.B \-ldots
Allow ISO9660 filenames to begin with a period.  Usually, a leading dot is
replaced with an underscore in order to maintain MS-DOS compatibility.
.br
This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems.
Use with caution.
.TP
.B \-allow\-lowercase
This options allows lowercase characters to appear in ISO9660 filenames.
.br
This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work on some systems.
Use with caution.
.TP
.B \-allow\-multidot
This options allows more than one dot to appear in ISO9660 filenames.
A leading dot is not affected by this option, it
may be allowed separately using
.BR \-allow\-leading\-dots .
.br
This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems.
Use with caution.
.TP
.BI \-biblio " file"
Specifies the bibliographic filename.  There is space for 37 characters.
Equivalent to
.B BIBL
in the
.I .genisoimagerc
file.
.TP
.B \-cache\-inodes
.TP
.B \-no\-cache\-inodes
Enable or disable caching inode and device numbers to find hard links
to files.  If
.B genisoimage
finds a hard link (a file with multiple names), the file will also be
hard-linked on the CD, so the file contents only appear once.  This
helps to save space.
.B \-cache\-inodes
is default on Unix-like operating systems, but
.B \-no\-cache\-inodes
is default on some other systems such as Cygwin, because it is not safe
to assume that inode numbers are unique on those systems.  (Some
versions of Cygwin create fake inode numbers using a weak hashing
algorithm, which may produce duplicates.)  If two files have the same
inode number but are not hard links to the same file,
.B genisoimage \-cache\-inodes
will not behave correctly.
.B \-no\-cache\-inodes
is safe in all situations, but in that case
.B genisoimage
cannot detect hard links, so the resulting CD image may be larger
than necessary.
.TP
.BI \-alpha\-boot " alpha_boot_image"
Specifies the path and filename of the boot image to be used when
making an Alpha/SRM bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to the
source path specified to
.BR genisoimage .
.TP
.BI \-hppa\-bootloader " hppa_bootloader_image"
Specifies the path and filename of the boot image to be used when
making an HPPA bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to the
source path specified to
.BR genisoimage .
Other options are required, at the very least a kernel filename and
a boot command line.  See the
.B HPPA NOTES
section below for more information.
.TP
.BI \-hppa\-cmdline " hppa_boot_command_line"
Specifies the command line to be passed to the HPPA boot loader when
making a bootable CD. Separate the parameters with spaces or
commas. More options must be passed to
.B genisoimage,
at the very least a kernel filename and the boot loader filename.
See the
.B HPPA NOTES
section below for more information.
.TP
.BI \-hppa\-kernel\-32 " hppa_kernel_32"
.TP
.BI \-hppa\-kernel\-64 " hppa_kernel_64"
Specifies the path and filename of the 32-bit and/or 64-bit kernel images
to be used when making an HPPA bootable CD. The pathnames must be
relative to the source path specified to
.BR genisoimage .
Other options are required, at the very least the boot loader filename
and the boot command line.  See the
.B HPPA NOTES
section below for more information.
.TP
.BI \-hppa\-ramdisk " hppa_ramdisk_image"
Specifies the path and filename of the ramdisk image to be used when
making an HPPA bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to the
source path specified to
.BR genisoimage .
This parameter is optional.  Other options are required, at the very
least a kernel filename and the boot command line. See the
.B HPPA NOTES
section below for more information.
.TP
.BI \-mips\-boot " mips_boot_image"
Specifies the path and filename of the boot image to be used when
making an SGI/big-endian MIPS bootable CD. The pathname must be
relative to the source path specified to
.BR genisoimage .
This option may be specified several times, to store up to 15 boot
images.
.TP
.BI \-mipsel\-boot " mipsel_boot_image"
Specifies the path and filename of the boot image to be used when
making an DEC/little-endian MIPS bootable CD. The pathname must be
relative to the source path specified to
.BR genisoimage .
.TP
.BI \-B " img_sun4,img_sun4c,img_sun4m,img_sun4d,img_sun4e"
.TP
.BI \-sparc\-boot " img_sun4,img_sun4c,img_sun4m,img_sun4d,img_sun4e"
Specifies a comma-separated list of boot images that are needed to make
a bootable CD for SPARC systems.
Partition 0 is used for the ISO9660 image, the first image file is mapped
to partition 1.
The comma-separated list may have up to 7 fields, including empty fields.
This option is required to make a bootable CD for Sun SPARC systems.
If
.B \-B
or
.B \-sparc\-boot
has been specified, the first sector of the resulting image will
contain a Sun disk label. This disk label specifies slice 0 for the
ISO9660 image and slices 1 to 7 for the boot images that
have been specified with this option. Byte offsets 512 to 8191
within each of the additional boot images must contain a primary boot
that works for the appropriate SPARC architecture. The rest of each
of the images usually contains a UFS filesystem used for the primary
kernel boot stage.
.IP
The implemented boot method is the one found with SunOS 4.x and SunOS 5.x.
However, it does not depend on SunOS internals but only on properties of
the Open Boot prom, so it should be usable for any OS for SPARC systems.
For more information also see the 
.B NOTES
section below.
.IP
If the special filename
.B ...
is used, the actual and all following boot partitions are mapped to the
previous partition. If
.B genisoimage
is called with
.BI \-G " image " \-B " ..."
all boot partitions are mapped to the partition that contains the ISO9660
filesystem image and the generic boot image that is located in the first
16 sectors of the disc is used for all architectures.
.TP
.BI \-G " generic_boot_image"
Specifies the path and filename of the generic boot image to be used when making
a generic bootable CD.  The boot image will be placed on the first 16
sectors of the CD, before the ISO9660 primary volume descriptor.
If this option is used together with
.BR \-sparc\-boot ,
the Sun disk label will overlay the first 512 bytes of the generic
boot image.
.TP
.BI \-b " eltorito_boot_image"
Specifies the path and filename of the boot image to be used when making
an El Torito bootable CD for x86 PCs. The pathname must be relative to
the source path specified to
.BR genisoimage .
This option is required to make an El Torito bootable CD.
The boot image must be exactly 1200 kB, 1440 kB or 2880 kB, and
.B genisoimage
will use this size when creating the output ISO9660 filesystem.  The PC
BIOS will use the image to emulate a floppy disk, so the first 512-byte
sector should contain PC boot code.  This will work, for example, if
the boot image is a LILO-based boot floppy.
.IP
If the boot image is not an image of a floppy, you need to add either
.BR \-hard\-disk\-boot " or " \-no\-emul\-boot .
If the system should not boot off the emulated disk, use
.BR \-no\-boot .
.IP
If
.B \-sort
has not been specified, the boot images are sorted
with low priority (+2) to the beginning of the medium.
If you don't like this, you need to specify a sort weight of 0 for the boot images.
.TP
.B \-eltorito\-alt\-boot
Start with a new set of El Torito boot parameters.  Up to 63 El Torito
boot entries may be stored on a single CD.
.TP
.BI \-hard\-disk\-boot
Specifies that the boot image used to create El Torito bootable CDs is
a hard disk image. The image must begin with a master boot
record that contains a single partition.
.TP
.BI \-no\-emul\-boot
Specifies that the boot image used to create El Torito bootable CDs is
a "no emulation" image. The system will load and execute this image without
performing any disk emulation.
.TP
.BI \-no\-boot
Specifies that the created El Torito CD should be marked as not bootable. The
system will provide an emulated drive for the image, but will boot off
a standard boot device.
.TP
.BI \-boot\-load\-seg " segment_address"
Specifies the load segment address of the boot image for no-emulation
El Torito CDs.
.TP
.BI \-boot\-load\-size " load_sectors"
Specifies the number of "virtual" (512-byte) sectors to load in
no-emulation mode.  The default is to load the entire boot file.  Some
BIOSes may have problems if this is not a multiple of 4.
.TP
.B \-boot\-info\-table
Specifies that a 56-byte table with information of the CD-ROM layout
will be patched in at offset 8 in the boot file.  If this option is
given, the boot file is
.IR "modified in the source filesystem" ,
so make a copy of this file if it cannot be easily regenerated!
See the
.B EL TORITO BOOT INFO TABLE
section for a description of this table.
.TP
.BI \-C " last_sess_start,next_sess_start"
This option is needed to create a CD Extra or the image of a second
session or a higher-level session for a multisession disc.
.B \-C
takes two numbers separated by a comma. The first is the first sector
in the last session of the disc that should be appended to.
The second number is the starting sector number of the new session.
The correct numbers may be retrieved by calling
.B wodim \-msinfo ...
If
.B \-C
is used in conjunction with
.BR \-M ,
.B genisoimage
will create a filesystem image that is intended to be a continuation
of the previous session.
If
.B \-C
is used without
.BR \-M ,
.B genisoimage
will create a filesystem image that is intended to be used for a second
session on a CD Extra. This is a multisession CD that holds audio data
in the first session and an ISO9660 filesystem in the second session.
.TP
.BI \-c " boot_catalog"
Specifies the path and filename of the boot catalog, which is required
for an El Torito bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to the source
path specified to
.BR genisoimage .
This file will be inserted into the output tree and not created
in the source filesystem, so be
sure the specified filename does not conflict with an existing file, or
it will be excluded. Usually a name like
.I boot.catalog
is chosen.
.IP
If
.B \-sort
has not been specified, the boot catalog sorted
with low priority (+1) to the beginning of the medium.
If you don't like this, you need to specify a sort weight of 0 for the boot catalog.
.TP
.B \-check\-oldnames
Check all filenames imported from the old session for compliance with
the ISO9660 file naming rules.
Without this option, only names longer than 31 characters are checked,
as these files are a serious violation of the ISO9660 standard.
.TP
.BI \-check\-session " file"
Check all old sessions for compliance with actual
.B genisoimage 
ISO9660 file naming rules.
This is a high-level option that combines
.B \-M
.I file
.BR "\-C 0,0 \-check\-oldnames" .
For the parameter 
.IR file ,
see the description of
.BR \-M .
.TP
.BI \-copyright " file"
Specifies copyright information, typically a filename on the disc.
There is space for 37 characters.  Equivalent to
.B COPY
in the
.I .genisoimagerc
file.
.TP
.B \-d
Do not append a period to files that do not have one.
.br
This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems.
Use with caution.
.TP
.B \-D
Do not use deep directory relocation, and instead just pack them in the
way we see them.
.br
If ISO9660:1999 has not been selected,
this violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems.
Use with caution.
.TP
.BI \-dir\-mode " mode"
Overrides the mode of directories used to create the image to
.IR mode ,
specified as 4 digits of permission bits as in
.BR chmod (1).
This option automatically enables Rock Ridge extensions.
.TP
.B \-dvd\-video
Generate a DVD-Video compliant UDF filesystem. This is done by sorting the
order of the content of the appropriate files and by adding padding 
between the files if needed.
Note that the sorting only works if the DVD-Video filenames include uppercase
characters only.
.IP
Note that in order to get a DVD-Video compliant filesystem image, you
need to prepare a DVD-Video compliant directory tree.  This requires a
directory
.B VIDEO_TS
(all caps) in the root directory of the resulting DVD, and usually
another directory
.BR AUDIO_TS .
.B VIDEO_TS
needs to include all needed files (filenames must be all caps) for a
compliant DVD-Video filesystem.
.TP
.B \-f
Follow symbolic links when generating the filesystem.  When this option is not
in use, symbolic links will be entered using Rock Ridge if enabled, otherwise
they will be ignored.
.TP
.BI \-file\-mode " mode"
Overrides the mode of regular files used to create the image to
.IR mode ,
specified as 4 digits of permission bits as in
.BR chmod (1).
This option automatically enables Rock Ridge extensions.
.TP
.BI \-gid " gid"
Overrides the group ID read from the source files to the value of
.IR gid . 
Specifying this option automatically enables Rock Ridge extensions.
.TP
.B \-gui
Switch the behaviour for a GUI. This currently makes the output more verbose
but may have other effects in the future.
.TP
.B \-graft\-points
Allow use of graft points for filenames. If this option is used, all
filenames are checked for graft points. The filename is divided at the
first unescaped equal sign. All occurrences of `\(rs' and `=' characters
must be escaped with `\(rs' if
.B \-graft\-points
has been specified.
.TP
.BI \-hide " glob"
Hide any files matching
.IR glob ,
a shell wildcard pattern, from being seen in the ISO9660 or Rock Ridge
directory.
.I glob
may match any part of the filename or path.  If
.I glob
matches a directory, the contents of that directory will be hidden.
In order to match a directory name, make sure the pathname does not include
a trailing `/' character.
All the hidden files will still be written to the output CD image file.
See also
.BR \-hide\-joliet ,
and
.IR README.hide .
This option may be used multiple times.
.TP
.BI \-hide\-list " file"
A file containing a list of shell wildcards to be hidden.  See
.BR \-hide .
.TP
.BI \-hidden " glob"
Add the hidden (existence) ISO9660 directory attribute for files and
directories matching
.IR glob ,
a shell wildcard pattern.  This attribute will prevent the files from
being shown by some MS-DOS and Windows commands.
.I glob
may match any part of the filename or path.
In order to match a directory name, make sure the pathname does not include
a trailing `/' character.
This option may be used multiple times.
.TP
.BI \-hidden\-list " file"
A file containing a list of shell wildcards to get the hidden
attribute.  See
.BR \-hidden .
.TP
.BI \-hide\-joliet " glob"
Hide files and directories matching
.IR glob ,
a shell wildcard pattern, from being seen in the Joliet directory.
.I glob
may match any part of the filename or path.  If
.I glob
matches a directory, the contents of that directory will be hidden.
In order to match a directory name, make sure the pathname does not include
a trailing `/' character.
All the hidden files will still be written to the output CD image file.
This option is usually used with
.BR \-hide .
See also
.IR README.hide .
This option may be used multiple times.
.TP
.BI \-hide\-joliet\-list " file"
A file containing a list of shell wildcards to be hidden from the
Joliet tree.  See
.BR \-hide\-joliet .
.TP
.B \-hide\-joliet\-trans\-tbl
Hide the
.I TRANS.TBL
files from the Joliet tree.
These files usually don't make sense in the Joliet world as they list
the real name and the ISO9660 name which may both be different from the
Joliet name.
.TP
.B \-hide\-rr\-moved
Rename the directory
.I RR_MOVED
to
.I .rr_moved
in the Rock Ridge tree.
It seems to be impossible to completely hide the
.I RR_MOVED
directory from the Rock Ridge tree.
This option only makes the visible tree less confusing for
people who don't know what this directory is for.
If you need to have no
.I RR_MOVED
directory at all, you should use
.BR \-D .
Note that if
.B \-D
has been specified, the resulting filesystem is not ISO9660
level-1 compliant and will not be readable on MS-DOS.
See also the
.B NOTES
section.
.TP
.BI \-input\-charset " charset"
Input charset that defines the characters used in local filenames.
To get a list of valid charset names, call
.BR "genisoimage \-input\-charset help" .
To get a 1:1 mapping, you may use
.B default
as charset name. The default initial values are
.I cp437
on DOS-based systems and
.I iso8859-1
on all other systems.  See the
.B CHARACTER SETS
section below for more details.
.TP
.BI \-output\-charset " charset"
Output charset that defines the characters that will be used in Rock Ridge
filenames.  Defaults to the input charset.  See
.B CHARACTER SETS
section below for more details.
.TP
.BI \-iso\-level " level"
Set the ISO9660 conformance level. Valid numbers are 1 to 4.
.IP
With level 1, files may only consist of one section and filenames are
restricted to 8.3 characters.
.IP
With level 2, files may only consist of one section.
.IP
With level 3, no restrictions (other than ISO-9660:1988) do apply.
.IP
With all ISO9660 levels from 1 to 3, all filenames are restricted to
uppercase letters, numbers and underscores (_). Filenames are
limited to 31 characters, directory nesting is limited to 8
levels, and pathnames are limited to 255 characters.
.IP
Level 4 officially does not exist but
.B genisoimage
maps it to ISO-9660:1999, which is ISO9660 version 2.
.IP
With level 4, an enhanced volume descriptor with version number
and file structure version number set to 2 is emitted.
Directory nesting is not limited to 8 levels,
there is no need for a file to contain a dot and the dot has no
special meaning, filenames do not have version numbers,
.\" (f XXX ??? The character used for filling byte positions which are
.\"     specified to be characters is subject to agreement between the
.\"     originator and the recipient of the volume),
and filenames can be up to 207 characters long, or 197 characters if
Rock Ridge is used.
.IP
When creating Version 2 images,
.B genisoimage
emits an enhanced volume descriptor, similar but not identical to a
primary volume descriptor. Be careful not to use broken software
to make ISO9660 images bootable by assuming a second PVD copy and patching 
this putative PVD copy into an El Torito VD.
.TP
.B \-J
Generate Joliet directory records in addition to regular ISO9660
filenames.  This is primarily useful when the discs are to be used on
Windows machines.  Joliet filenames are specified in Unicode and each
path component can be up to 64 Unicode characters long.
Note that Joliet is not a standard \(em only Microsoft Windows and Linux
systems can read Joliet extensions.  For greater portability, consider
using both Joliet and Rock Ridge extensions.
.TP
.B \-joliet\-long
Allow Joliet filenames to be up to 103 Unicode characters, instead of
64.  This breaks the Joliet specification, but appears to work. Use
with caution.
.\" The number 103 is derived from: the maximum Directory Record Length
.\" (254), minus the length of Directory Record (33), minus CD-ROM XA
.\" System Use Extension Information (14), divided by the UTF-16
.\" character size (2).
.TP
.BI \-jcharset " charset"
A combination of
.B \-J \-input\-charset
.IR charset .
See the
.B CHARACTER SETS
section below for more details.
.TP
.B \-l
Allow full 31-character filenames.  Normally the ISO9660 filename will be in an
8.3 format which is compatible with MS-DOS, even though the ISO9660 standard
allows filenames of up to 31 characters.  If you use this option, the disc may
be difficult to use on a MS-DOS system, but will work on most other systems.
Use with caution.
.TP
.B \-L
Outdated option; use
.B \-allow\-leading\-dots

.I .jigdo
metadata file as well as the filesystem image.  See the
.B JIGDO NOTES
section below for more information.
.TP
.BI \-jigdo\-template " template_file"
Produce a
.B jigdo
.I .template

.B JIGDO NOTES
section below for more information.
.TP
.BI \-jigdo\-min\-file\-size " size"
Specify the minimum size for a file to be listed in the
.I .jigdo
file. Default (and minimum allowed) is 1KB. See the
.B JIGDO NOTES
section below for more information.
.TP
.BI \-jigdo\-force\-md5 " path"
Specify a file pattern where files
.I must
be contained in the externally-supplied MD5 list as supplied by
.BR \-md5\-list .
See the
.B JIGDO NOTES
section below for more information.
.TP
.BI \-jigdo\-exclude " path"
Specify a file pattern where files will not be listed in the
.I .jigdo

.B JIGDO NOTES
section below for more information.
.TP
.BI \-jigdo\-map " path"
Specify a pattern mapping for the jigdo file
(e.g.
.IR Debian=/mirror/debian ).
See the
.B JIGDO NOTES
section below for more information.
.TP
.BI \-md5\-list " md5_file"
Specify a file containing the MD5sums, sizes and pathnames of the
files to be included in the
.I .jigdo
file. See the
.B JIGDO NOTES
section below for more information.
.TP
.BI \-jigdo\-template\-compress " algorithm
Specify a compression algorithm to use for template date. gzip and
bzip2 are currently supported, and gzip is the default. See the
.B JIGDO NOTES
section below for more information.
.TP
.BI \-log\-file " log_file"
Redirect all error, warning and informational messages to
.I log_file
instead of the standard error.
.TP
.BI \-m " glob"
Exclude files matching
.IR glob ,
a shell wildcard pattern, from being written to CD-ROM.
.I glob
may match either the filename component or the full pathname.
This option may be used multiple times.  For example:
.sp
     genisoimage \-o rom \-m \(aq*.o\(aq \-m core \-m foobar
.sp
would exclude all files ending in `.o', or called
.IR core " or " foobar
from the image.  Note that if you had a directory called
.IR foobar ,
it too (and of course all its descendants) would be excluded.
.TP
.BI \-exclude\-list " file"
A file containing a list of shell wildcards to be excluded.  See
.BR \-m .
.TP
.B \-max\-iso9660\-filenames
Allow ISO9660 filenames to be up to 37 characters long.
This option enables
.B \-N
as the extra name space is taken from the space reserved for
file version numbers.
.br
This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems.
Although a conforming application needs to provide a buffer space of at
least 37 characters, discs created with this option may cause a buffer
overflow in the reading operating system. Use with extreme care.
.TP
.BI \-M " path"
.TP
.BI \-M " device"
.TP
.BI \-dev " device"
Specifies path to existing ISO9660 image to be merged. The alternate form
takes a SCSI device specifier that uses the same syntax as the
.B dev=
parameter of
.BR wodim .
The output of 
.B genisoimage
will be a new session which should get written to the end of the
image specified in
.BR \-M .
Typically this requires multisession capability for the CD recorder
used to write the image.  This option may only be used in conjunction
with
.BR \-C .
.TP
.B \-N
Omit version numbers from ISO9660 filenames.
.br
This violates the ISO9660 standard, but no one really uses the
version numbers anyway.  Use with caution.
.TP
.BI \-new\-dir\-mode " mode"
Specify the mode, a 4-digit number as used in
.BR chmod (1),
to use when creating new directories in the filesystem image.  The
default is 0555.
.TP
.B \-nobak
.TP
.B \-no\-bak
Exclude backup files files on the ISO9660 filesystem; that is,
filenames that contain the characters `~' or `#' or end in
.IR .bak .
These are typically backup files for Unix text editors.
.TP
.B \-force\-rr
Do not use the automatic Rock Ridge attributes recognition for previous sessions.
This can work around problems with images created by, e.g., NERO Burning ROM.
.TP
.B \-no\-rr
Do not use the Rock Ridge attributes from previous sessions.
This may help to avoid problems when
.B genisoimage
finds illegal Rock Ridge signatures on an old session.
.TP
.B \-no\-split\-symlink\-components
Don't split the symlink components, but begin a new Continuation Area (CE)
instead. This may waste some space, but the SunOS 4.1.4 cdrom driver
has a bug in reading split symlink components.
.IP
It is questionable whether this option is useful nowadays.
.TP
.B \-no\-split\-symlink\-fields
Don't split the symlink fields, but begin a new Continuation Area (CE)
instead. This may waste some space, but the SunOS 4.1.4 and
Solaris 2.5.1 cdrom driver have a bug in reading split symlink fields
(a `/' can be dropped).
.IP
It is questionable whether this option is useful nowadays.
.TP
.BI \-o " filename"
Specify the output file for the the ISO9660 filesystem image.
This can be a disk file, a tape drive, or it can correspond directly
to the device name of the optical disc writer.  If not specified, stdout is
used.  Note that the output can also be a block device for a regular
disk partition, in which case the ISO9660 filesystem can be mounted
normally to verify that it was generated correctly.
.TP
.B \-pad
Pad the end of the whole image by 150 sectors (300 kB).  This option is
enabled by default.  If used in combination with
.BR \-B ,
padding is inserted between the ISO9660 partition and the boot
partitions, such that the first boot partition starts
on a sector number that is a multiple of 16.
.IP
The padding is needed as many operating systems (e.g. Linux)
implement read-ahead bugs in their filesystem I/O. These bugs result in read
errors on files that are located near the end of a track, particularly
if the disc is written in Track At Once mode, or where a CD audio track
follows the data track.
.\" XXX: Someone should check to see if the Linux readahead bug is
.\" XXX: still present, and update this comment accordingly.
.TP
.B \-no\-pad
Do not pad the end by 150 sectors (300 kB) and do not make the the boot partitions
start on a multiple of 16 sectors.
.TP
.BI \-path\-list " file"
A file containing a list of
.I pathspec
directories and filenames to be added to the ISO9660 filesystem. This list
of pathspecs are processed after any that appear on the command line. If the
argument is
.IR \- ,
the list is read from the standard input.
.TP
.B \-P
Outdated option; use
.B \-publisher
instead.
.TP
.BI \-publisher " publisher_id"
Specifies a text string that will be written into the volume header.
This should describe the publisher of the CD-ROM, usually with a
mailing address and phone number.  There is space for 128 characters.
Equivalent to
.B PUBL
in the
.I .genisoimagerc
file.
.TP
.BI \-p " preparer_id"
Specifies a text string that will be written into the volume header.
This should describe the preparer of the CD-ROM, usually with a mailing
address and phone number.  There is space for 128 characters.
Equivalent to
.B PREP
in the
.I .genisoimagerc
file.
.TP
.B \-print\-size
Print estimated filesystem size in multiples of the sector size (2048 bytes)
and exit. This option is needed for
Disk At Once mode and with some CD-R drives when piping directly into
.BR wodim ,
cases where
.B wodim
needs to know the size of the filesystem image in advance.
Old versions of
.B mkisofs
wrote this information (among other information) to 
.IR stderr .
As this turns out to be hard to parse, the number without any other information
is now printed on 
.I stdout
too.
If you like to write a simple shell script, redirect
.I stderr
and catch the number from
.IR stdout .
This may be done with:
.sp
     cdblocks=\` genisoimage \-print\-size \-quiet .\|.\|. \`
.br
     genisoimage .\|.\|. | wodim .\|.\|. tsize=${cdblocks}s \-
.TP
.B \-quiet
This makes
.B genisoimage
even less verbose.  No progress output will be provided.
.TP
.B \-R
Generate SUSP and RR records using the Rock Ridge protocol to further describe
the files on the ISO9660 filesystem.
.TP
.B \-r
This is like the \-R option, but file ownership and modes are set to
more useful values.  The uid and gid are set to zero, because they are
usually only useful on the author's system, and not useful to the
client.  All the file read bits are set true, so that files and
directories are globally readable on the client.  If any execute bit is
set for a file, set all of the execute bits, so that executables are
globally executable on the client.  If any search bit is set for a
directory, set all of the search bits, so that directories are globally
searchable on the client.  All write bits are cleared, because the
filesystem will be mounted read-only in any case.  If any of the special
mode bits are set, clear them, because file locks are not useful on a
read-only filesystem, and set-id bits are not desirable for uid 0 or
gid 0.
When used on Win32, the execute bit is set on
.I all
files. This is a result of the lack of file permissions on Win32 and the
Cygwin POSIX emulation layer.  See also
.BR \-uid ", " \-gid ,
.BR \-dir\-mode ", " \-file\-mode
and
.BR \-new\-dir\-mode .
.TP
.B \-relaxed\-filenames
Allows ISO9660 filenames to include all 7-bit ASCII characters except
lowercase letters.
.br
This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems.
Use with caution.
.TP
.BI \-root " dir"
Moves all files and directories into
.I dir
in the image. This is essentially the
same as using 
.B \-graft\-points
and adding
.I dir
in front of every pathspec, but is easier to use.
.I dir
may actually be several levels deep. It is
created with the same permissions as other graft points.
.TP
.BI \-old-root " dir"
This option is necessary when writing a multisession
image and the previous (or even older) session was written with
.B -root
.IR dir .
Using a directory name not found in the previous session
causes
.B genisoimage
to abort with an error.
Without this option,
.B genisoimage
would not be able to find unmodified files and would
be forced to write their data into the image once more.
.B \-root
and
.B \-old-root
are meant to be used together to do incremental backups.
The initial session would e.g. use:
.B genisoimage \-root backup_1
.IR dirs .
The next incremental backup with
.B genisoimage \-root backup_2 \-old-root backup_1
.I dirs
would take another snapshot of these directories. The first
snapshot would be found in
.BR backup_1 ,
the second one in
.BR backup_2 ,
but only modified or new files need to be written
into the second session.
Without these options, new files would be added and old ones would be
preserved. But old ones would be overwritten if the file was
modified. Recovering the files by copying the whole directory back
from CD would also restore files that were deleted
intentionally. Accessing several older versions of a file requires
support by the operating system to choose which sessions are to be
mounted.
.TP
.BI \-sort " sort_file"
Sort file locations on the media. Sorting is controlled by a file that
contains pairs of filenames and sorting offset weighting.
If the weighting is higher, the file will be located closer to the
beginning of the media, if the weighting is lower, the file will be located
closer to the end of the media. There must be only one space or tabs
character between the filename and the
weight and the weight must be the last characters on a line. The filename
is taken to include all the characters up to, but not including the last
space or tab character on a line. This is to allow for space characters to
be in, or at the end of a filename.
This option does
.B not
sort the order of the filenames that appear
in the ISO9660 directory. It sorts the order in which the file data is
written to the CD image, which is useful in order to optimize the
data layout on a CD. See
.B README.sort
for more details.
.TP
.BI \-sparc\-boot " img_sun4,img_sun4c,img_sun4m,img_sun4d,img_sun4e"
See
.B \-B
above.
.TP
.BI \-sparc\-label " label"
Set the Sun disk label name for the Sun disk label that is created with
.BR \-sparc-boot .
.TP
.B \-split\-output
Split the output image into several files of approximately 1 GB each.
This helps to create DVD-sized ISO9660 images on operating systems without
large file support.
.B wodim
will concatenate more than one file into a single track if writing to a DVD.
To make
.B \-split\-output
work,
.BI \-o " filename"
must be specified. The resulting output images will be named:
.IR filename_00 ", " filename_01 ", " filename_02 ....
.TP
.BI \-stream\-media\-size " #"
Select streaming operation and set the media size to # sectors.
This allows you to pipe the output of the
.BR tar (1)
program into
.B genisoimage
and to create an ISO9660 filesystem without the need of an intermediate
tar archive file. 
If this option has been specified,
.B genisoimage
reads from 
.I stdin 
and creates a file with the name
.IR STREAM.IMG .
The maximum size of the file (with padding) is 200 sectors less than the 
specified media size. If 
.B \-no\-pad
has been specified, the file size is 50 sectors less than the specified media size.
If the file is smaller,
.B genisoimage
will write padding. This may take awhile.
.IP
The option 
.B \-stream\-media\-size
creates simple ISO9660 filesystems only and may not used together with multisession
or hybrid filesystem options.
.TP
.BI \-stream\-file\-name " name"
Reserved for future use.
.TP
.BI \-sunx86\-boot " UFS_img,,,AUX1_img"
Specifies a comma-separated list of filesystem images that are needed to make
a bootable CD for Solaris x86 systems.
.IP
Note that partition 1 is used for the ISO9660 image and that partition 2 is
the whole disk, so partition 1 and 2 may not be used by external partition data.
The first image file is mapped to partition 0.
There may be empty fields in the comma-separated list,
and list entries for partition 1 and 2 must be empty.
The maximum number of supported partitions is 8 (although the Solaris x86
partition table could support up to 16 partitions), so it is impossible
to specify more than 6 partition images.
This option is required to make a bootable CD for Solaris x86 systems.
.IP
If
.B \-sunx86\-boot
has been specified, the first sector of the resulting image will
contain a PC fdisk label with a Solaris type 0x82 fdisk partition that
starts at offset 512 and spans the whole CD.
In addition, for the Solaris type 0x82 fdisk partition, there is a
SVr4 disk label at offset 1024 in the first sector of the CD.
This disk label specifies slice 0 for the first (usually UFS type)
filesystem image that is used to boot the PC and slice 1 for
the ISO9660 image.
Slice 2 spans the whole CD slice 3 .\|.\|. slice 7 may be used for additional
filesystem images that have been specified with this option.
.IP
A Solaris x86 boot CD uses a 1024 byte sized primary boot that uses the
.B El-Torito no-emulation
boot mode and a secondary generic boot that is in CD sectors 1\|.\|.15.
For this reason, both
.BI "-b " bootimage " \-no\-emul\-boot"
and
.BI \-G " genboot"
must be specified.
.TP
.BI \-sunx86\-label " label"
Set the SVr4 disk label name for the SVr4 disk label that is created with
.BR \-sunx86-boot .
.TP
.BI \-sysid " ID"
Specifies the system ID.  There is space for 32 characters.
Equivalent to
.B SYSI
in the
.I .genisoimagerc
file.
.TP
.B \-T
Generate a file
.I TRANS.TBL
in each directory on the CD-ROM, which can be used
on non-Rock\ Ridge-capable systems to help establish the correct filenames.
There is also information present in the file that indicates the major and
minor numbers for block and character devices, and each symlink has the name of
the link file given.
.TP
.BI \-table\-name " table_name"
Alternative translation table filename (see above). Implies
.BR \-T .
If you are creating a multisession image you must use the same name
as in the previous session.
.TP
.BI \-ucs\-level " level"
Set Unicode conformance level in the Joliet SVD. The default level is 3.
It may be set to 1..3 using this option.
.TP
.B \-udf
Include UDF filesystem support in the generated filesystem image.  UDF
support is currently in alpha status and for this reason, it is not
possible to create UDF-only images.  UDF data structures are currently
coupled to the Joliet structures, so there are many pitfalls with the
current implementation. There is no UID/GID support, there is no POSIX
permission support, there is no support for symlinks.  Note that UDF
wastes the space from sector ~20 to sector 256 at the beginning of the
disc in addition to the space needed for real UDF data structures.
.TP
.BI \-uid " uid"
Overrides the uid read from the source files to the value of
.IR uid . 
Specifying this option automatically enables Rock Ridge extensions.
.TP
.B \-use\-fileversion
The option 
.B \-use\-fileversion
allows
.B genisoimage
to use file version numbers from the filesystem.
If the option is not specified, 
.B genisoimage
creates a version number of 1 for all files.
File versions are strings in the range 
.I ;1
to
.I ;32767
This option is the default on VMS. 
.TP
.B \-U
Allows "untranslated" filenames, completely violating the ISO9660 standards
described above.  Enables the following flags:
.B \-d \-l \-N \-allow\-leading\-dots \-relaxed\-filenames
.BR "\-allow\-lowercase \-allow\-multidot \-no\-iso\-translate" .
Allows more than one `.' character in the filename, as well as
mixed-case filenames.  This is useful on HP-UX, where the built-in
.I cdfs
filesystem does not recognize any extensions. Use with extreme caution.
.TP
.B \-no\-iso\-translate
Do not translate the characters `#' and `~' which are invalid for ISO9660 filenames.
Although invalid, these characters are often used by Microsoft systems.
.br
This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems.
Use with caution.
.TP
.BI \-V " volid"
Specifies the volume ID (volume name or label) to be written into the
master block.  There is space for 32 characters.  Equivalent to
.B VOLI
in the
.I .genisoimagerc
file.  The volume ID is used as the mount point by the Solaris volume
manager and as a label assigned to a disc on various other platforms
such as Windows and Apple Mac OS.
.TP
.BI \-volset " ID"
Specifies the volume set ID.  There is space for 128 characters.
Equivalent to
.B VOLS
in the
.I .genisoimagerc
file.
.TP
.BI \-volset\-size " #"
Sets the volume set size to #.
The volume set size is the number of CDs that are in a CD volume set.
A volume set is a collection of one or more volumes, on which a set of
files is recorded.
.IP
Volume Sets are not intended to be used to create a set numbered CDs
that are part of e.g. a Operation System installation set of CDs.
Volume Sets are rather used to record a big directory tree that would not
fit on a single volume.
Each volume of a Volume Set contains a description of all the directories
and files that are recorded on the volumes where the sequence numbers
are less than, or equal to, the assigned Volume Set Size of the current
volume.
.IP
.B genisoimage
currently does not support a
.B \-volset\-size
that is larger than 1.
.IP
The option
.B \-volset\-size
must be specified before
.B \-volset\-seqno
on each command line.
.TP
.BI \-volset\-seqno " #"
Sets the volume set sequence number to #.
The volume set sequence number is the index number of the current
CD in a CD set.
The option
.B \-volset\-size
must be specified before
.B \-volset\-seqno
on each command line.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose execution. If given twice on the command line, extra debug information
will be printed.
.TP
.BI \-x " glob"
Identical to
.B \-m
.IR glob .
.TP
.B \-z
Generate special
.I RRIP
records for transparently compressed files.
This is only of use and interest for hosts that support transparent
decompression, such as Linux 2.4.14 or later.  You must specify
.BR \-R " or " \-r
to enable Rock Ridge, and generate compressed files using the
.B mkzftree
utility before running
.BR genisoimage .
Note that transparent compression is a nonstandard Rock Ridge extension.
The resulting disks are only transparently readable if used on Linux.
On other operating systems you will need to call
.B mkzftree
by hand to decompress the files.
.\" ----------------------------------------
.SH "HFS OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-hfs
Create an ISO9660/HFS hybrid CD. This option should be used in conjunction
with the
.BR \-map ,
.B \-magic
and/or the various
.I double dash
options given below.
.TP
.B \-apple
Create an ISO9660 CD with Apple's extensions. Similar to
.BR \-hfs ,
except that the Apple Extensions to ISO9660 are added instead of
creating an HFS hybrid volume.
Former 
.B genisoimage
versions did include Rock Ridge attributes by default if 
.B \-apple
was specified. This versions of
.B genisoimage
does not do this anymore. If you like to have Rock Ridge attributes,
you need to specify this separately.
.TP
.BI \-map " mapping_file"
Use the
.I mapping_file
to set the CREATOR and TYPE information for a file based on the
filename's extension. A filename is 
mapped only if it is not one of the know Apple/Unix file formats. See the
.B HFS CREATOR/TYPE
section below.
.TP
.BI \-magic " magic_file"
The CREATOR and TYPE information is set by using a file's
.I magic number
(usually the first few bytes of a file). The
.I magic_file
is only used if a file is not one of the known Apple/Unix file formats, or
the filename extension has not been mapped using
.BR \-map .
See the 
.B HFS CREATOR/TYPE
section below for more details.
.TP
.BI \-hfs\-creator " creator"
Set the default CREATOR for all files. Must be exactly 4 characters. See the
.B HFS CREATOR/TYPE
section below for more details.
.TP
.BI \-hfs\-type " type"
Set the default TYPE for all files. Must be exactly 4 characters. See the
.B HFS CREATOR/TYPE
section below for more details.
.TP
.B \-probe
Search the contents of files for all the known Apple/Unix file formats.
See the
.B HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS
section below for more about these formats.
However, the only way to check for
.I MacBinary
and
.I AppleSingle
files is to open and read them, so this option may
increase processing time. It is better to use one or more
.I double dash
options given below if the Apple/Unix formats in use are known.
.TP
.B \-no\-desktop
Do not create (empty) Desktop files. New HFS Desktop files will be created
when the CD is used on a Macintosh (and stored in the System Folder).
By default, empty Desktop files are added to the HFS volume.
.TP
.B \-mac\-name
Use the HFS filename as the starting point for the ISO9660, Joliet and
Rock Ridge filenames. See the
.B HFS MACINTOSH FILENAMES
section below for more information.
.TP
.BI \-boot\-hfs\-file " driver_file"
Installs the
.I driver_file
that
.I may
make the CD bootable on a Macintosh. See the
.B HFS BOOT DRIVER
section below. (Alpha).
.TP
.B \-part
Generate an HFS partition table. By default, no partition table is generated,
but some older Macintosh CD-ROM drivers need an HFS partition table on the
CD-ROM to be able to recognize a hybrid CD-ROM.
.TP
.BI \-auto " AutoStart_file"
Make the HFS CD use the QuickTime 2.0 Autostart feature to launch an
application or document. The given filename must be the name of a document or
application located at the top level of the CD. The filename must be less
than 12 characters. (Alpha).
.TP
.BI \-cluster\-size " size"
Set the size in bytes of the cluster or allocation units of PC Exchange

.BR \-\-exchange .
See the
.B HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS
section below.
.TP
.BI \-hide\-hfs " glob"
Hide
.IR glob ,
a shell wildcard pattern, from the HFS volume.  The file or directory
will still exist in the ISO9660 and/or Joliet directory.
.I glob
may match any part of the filename.  Multiple globs may be excluded.
Example:
.sp
     genisoimage \-o rom \-hfs \-hide\-hfs \(aq*.o\(aq \-hide\-hfs foobar
.sp
would exclude all files ending in `.o' or called
.I foobar
from the HFS volume. Note that if you had a directory called
.IR foobar ,
it too (and of course all its descendants) would be excluded.  The
.I glob
can also be a path name relative to the source directories given on the
command line. Example:
.sp
     genisoimage \-o rom \-hfs \-hide\-hfs src/html src
.sp
would exclude just the file or directory called
.I html
from the
.I src
directory.  Any other file or directory called
.I html
in the tree will not be excluded.  Should be used with
.B \-hide
and/or
.BR \-hide\-joliet .
In order to match a directory name, make sure the pattern does not
include a trailing `/' character. See
.I README.hide

used with
.BR \-V .
.TP
.B \-icon\-position
Use the icon position information, if it exists, from the Apple/Unix file.
The icons will appear in the same position as they would on a Macintosh

.SH "CHARACTER SETS"
.B genisoimage
processes filenames in a POSIX-compliant way as strings of 8-bit characters.
To represent all codings for all languages, 8-bit characters are not
sufficient.  Unicode or ISO-10646
define character codings that need at least 21 bits to represent all
known languages. They may be represented with
.IR UTF-32 ", " UTF-16 " or " UTF-8
coding.  UTF-32 uses a plain 32-bit coding but seems to be uncommon.
UTF-16 is used by Microsoft with Win32 with the disadvantage that
16-bit characters are not compliant with the POSIX filesystem
interface.
.PP
Modern Unix operating systems may use UTF-8 coding for filenames.
Each 32-bit character is represented by one or more 8-bit characters.
If a character is coded in
.I ISO-8859-1
(used in Central Europe and North America) is maps 1:1 to a 
UTF-32 or UTF-16 coded Unicode character.
If a character is coded in
.I 7-Bit ASCII
(used in USA and other countries with limited character set)
is maps 1:1 to a UTF-32, UTF-16 or UTF-8 coded Unicode character.
Character codes that cannot be represented as a single byte in UTF-8
(if the value is > 0x7F) use escape sequences that map to more than
one 8-bit character.
.PP
If all operating systems used UTF-8,
.B genisoimage
would not need to recode characters in filenames.
Unfortunately, Apple uses completely nonstandard codings and Microsoft
uses a Unicode coding that is not compatible with the POSIX filename
interface.
.PP
For all non-UTF-8-coded operating systems, the actual character
that each byte represents depends on the
.I character set
or
.I codepage
(the name used by Microsoft)
used by the local operating system \(em the characters in a character
set will reflect the region or natural language set by the user.
.PP
Usually character codes 0x00-0x1f are control characters, codes 0x20-0x7f
are the 7-bit ASCII characters and (on PCs and Macs) 0x80-0xff are used
for other characters.
.PP
As there are a lot more than 256 characters/symbols in use, only a small
subset are represented in a character set. Therefore the same character code
may represent a different character in different character sets. So a filename
generated, say in central Europe, may not display the same character
when viewed on a machine in, say eastern Europe.
.PP
To make matters more complicated, different operating systems use
different character sets for the region or language. For example, the
character code for `\('e' (small e with acute accent)
may be character code 0x82 on a PC, 
code 0x8e on a Macintosh, code 0xe9 on a Unix system in western Europe,
and code 0x000e9 in Unicode.
.PP
As long as not all operating systems and applications use the same
character set as the basis for filenames, it may be
necessary to specify which character set your filenames use in and which
character set the filenames should appear on the CD.
.PP
There are four options to specify the character sets you want to use:
.TP
.B \-input\-charset
Defines the local character set you are using on your host machine.
Any character set conversions that take place will use this character
set as the starting point. The default input character sets are
.I cp437
on MS-DOS-based systems and
.I iso8859-1
on all other systems.  If
.B \-J
is given, the Unicode equivalents of the input character set
will be used in the Joliet directory.
.B \-jcharset
is the same as
.BR "\-input\-charset \-J" .
.TP
.B \-output\-charset
Defines the character set that will be used with for the Rock Ridge names
on the CD.  Defaults to the input character set.
.TP
.B \-input\-hfs\-charset
Defines the HFS character set used for HFS filenames decoded from
any of the various Apple/Unix file formats. Only useful when used with
.BR \-mac\-name .
See the
.B HFS MACINTOSH FILENAMES
for more information. Defaults to
.I cp10000
(Mac Roman).
.TP
.B \-output\-hfs\-charset
Defines the HFS character set used to create HFS filenames from the input
character set in use. In most cases this will be from the character set
given with
.BR \-input\-charset .
Defaults to the input HFS character set.
.PP
There are a number of character sets built in to
.BR genisoimage .
To get a listing, use
.BR "\-input\-charset help" .
This list doesn't include the charset derived from the current locale,
if
.B genisoimage
is built with
.I iconv
support.
.PP
Additional character sets can be read from file for any of the character
set options by giving a filename as the argument to the options. The given
file will only be read if its name does not match one of the built-in
character sets.
.PP
The format of the character set files is the same as the mapping files
available from
.IR http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS .
This format is:
.IP
Column #1 is the input byte code (in hex as 0xXX)
.br
Column #2 is the Unicode (in hex as 0xXXXX)
.br
The rest of the line is ignored.
.PP
Any blank line, line without two (or more) columns in the above format
or comments lines (starting with the # character) are ignored without any
warnings. Any missing input code is mapped to Unicode character 0x0000.
.PP
Note that, while UTF-8 is supported, other Unicode encodings such as
UCS-2/UTF-16 and UCS-4/UTF-32 are not, as POSIX operating systems
cannot handle them natively.
.PP
A 1:1 character set mapping can be defined by using the keyword
.I default
as the argument to any of the character set options. This is the behaviour
of old versions of
.BR mkisofs .
.PP
The ISO9660 filenames generated from the input filenames are not converted
from the input character set. The ISO9660 character set is a very limited
subset of the ASCII characters, so any conversion would be pointless.
.PP
Any character that
.B genisoimage
cannot convert will be replaced with a `_' character.
.\" ----------------------------------------
.SH "HFS CREATOR/TYPE"
A Macintosh file has two properties associated with it which define
which application created the file, the
.I CREATOR
and what data the file contains, the
.IR TYPE .
Both are (exactly) 4 letter strings. Usually this
allows a Macintosh user to double-click on a file and launch the correct
application etc. The CREATOR and TYPE of a particular file can be found by
using something like ResEdit (or similar) on a Macintosh.
.PP
The CREATOR and TYPE information is stored in all the various Apple/Unix
encoded files.
For other files it is possible to base the CREATOR and TYPE on the
filename's extension using a
.I mapping
file (with
.BR \-map )
and/or using the
.I magic number
(usually a
.I signature
in the first few bytes) of a file (with
.BR \-magic ).
If both these options are given, their order on the command
line is significant.  If
.B \-map
is given first, a filename extension match is attempted
before a magic number match. However, if
.B \-magic
is given first, a magic number match is attempted before a
filename extension match.
.PP
If a mapping or magic file is not used, or no match is found, the default
CREATOR and TYPE for all regular files can be set by using entries in the 
.I .genisoimagerc
file or using
.B \-hfs\-creator
and/or
.BR \-hfs\-type ,
otherwise the default CREATOR and TYPE are
.IR Unix " and " TEXT .
.PP
The format of the
.I mapping
file is the same
.I afpfile
format as used by
.BR aufs .
This file has five columns for the
.IR extension ,
.IR "file translation" ,
.IR CREATOR ,
.IR TYPE " and"
.IR Comment .
Lines starting with the `#' character are
comment lines and are ignored. An example file would be like:
.PP
.TS
tab (/);
l s s s s
l s s s s
l l l l l .

.TE
.PP
Where:
.IP
The first column
.I EXTN
defines the Unix filename extension to be
mapped. The default mapping for any filename extension that doesn't
match is defined with the `*' character.
.IP
The
.I Xlate
column defines the type of text translation between the Unix and
Macintosh file it is ignored by
.BR genisoimage ,
but is kept to be compatible with
.BR aufs (1).
Although 
.B genisoimage
does not alter the contents of a file, if a binary file has its TYPE
set as
.IR TEXT ", it " may
be read incorrectly on a Macintosh. Therefore a better choice for the
default TYPE may be
.IR ???? .
.IP
The
.I CREATOR
and
.I TYPE
keywords must be 4 characters long and enclosed in single quotes.
.IP
The comment field is enclosed in double quotes \(em it is ignored by
.BR genisoimage ,
but is kept to be compatible with 
.BR aufs .
.PP
The format of the
.I magic
file is almost identical to the
.BR magic (5)
file used by the
.BR file (1)
command.
.PP
This file has four tab-separated columns for the
.IR "byte offset" ,
.IR type ,
.I test
and
.IR message .
Lines starting with the `#' character are
comment lines and are ignored. An example file would be like:
.PP
.TS
tab (/);
l s s s

.TE
.PP
The format of the file is described in
.BR magic (5).
The only difference here is that for each entry in the magic file, the
.I message
for the initial offset must be be 4 characters for the CREATOR followed
by 4 characters for the TYPE \(em white space is
optional between them. Any other characters on this line are ignored.
Continuation lines (starting with a `>') are also ignored, i.e., only
the initial offset lines are used.
.PP
Using
.B \-magic
may significantly increase processing time as each file has to opened
and read to find its magic number.
.PP
In summary, for all files, the default CREATOR is
.I Unix
and the default TYPE is
.IR TEXT .
These can be changed by using entries in the
.I .genisoimagerc
file or by using
.B \-hfs\-creator
and/or
.BR \-hfs\-type .
.PP
If the a file is in one of the known Apple/Unix formats (and the format
has been selected), the CREATOR and TYPE are taken from the values
stored in the Apple/Unix file.
.PP
Other files can have their CREATOR and TYPE set from their filename
extension (with
.BR \-map ),
or their magic number (with
.BR \-magic ).
If the default match is used in the
.I mapping
file, these values override the default CREATOR and TYPE.
.PP
A full CREATOR/TYPE database can be found at 
.IR http://www.angelfire.com/il/szekely/ .
.\" ----------------------------------------
.SH "HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS"
Macintosh files have two parts called the
.I Data
and
.IR "Resource fork" .
Either may be empty. Unix (and many other OSs) can only
cope with files having one part (or fork). To add to this, Macintosh files
have a number of attributes associated with them \(em probably the most
important are the TYPE and CREATOR.  Again, Unix has no concept of these
types of attributes.
.PP
E.g., a Macintosh file may be a JPEG image where the image is stored in the
Data fork and a desktop thumbnail stored in the Resource fork. It is usually
the information in the data fork that is useful across platforms.
.PP
Therefore to store a Macintosh file on a Unix filesystem, a way has to be
found to cope with the two forks and the extra attributes (which are
referred to as the
.IR "Finder info" ).
Unfortunately, it seems that every software package that stores Macintosh
files on Unix has chosen a completely different storage method.
.PP
The Apple/Unix formats that
.B genisoimage
(partially) supports are:
.IP "CAP AUFS format"
Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork in subdirectory
.I .resource
with same filename as data fork. Finder info in subdirectory
.I .finderinfo
with same filename.
.IP "AppleDouble/Netatalk"
Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork stored in a file with
same name prefixed with `%'. Finder info also stored in same
`%' file. Netatalk uses the same format, but the resource
fork/Finder info stored in subdirectory
.I .AppleDouble
with same filename as data fork.
.IP AppleSingle
Data structures similar to above, except both forks and Finder
info are stored in one file.
.IP "Helios EtherShare"
Data fork stored in a file.  Resource fork and Finder info together in
subdirectory
.I .rsrc
with same filename as data fork.
.IP "IPT UShare"
Like the EtherShare format, but the Finder info
is stored slightly differently.
.IP MacBinary
Both forks and Finder info stored in one file.
.IP "Apple PC Exchange"
Used by Macintoshes to store Apple files on DOS (FAT) disks.
Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork in subdirectory
.IR resource.frk " (or " RESOURCE.FRK ).
Finder info as one record in file
.IR finder.dat " (or " FINDER.DAT ).
Separate
.I finder.dat
for each data fork directory.
.IP
Note: 
.B genisoimage
needs to know the native FAT cluster size of the disk that the PC Exchange
files are on (or have been copied from). This size is given by
.BR \-cluster\-size .
The cluster or allocation size can be found by using the DOS utility
.BR chkdsk .
.IP
May not work with PC Exchange v2.2 or higher files (available with MacOS 8.1).
DOS media containing PC Exchange files should be mounted as type
.I msdos
(not
.IR vfat )
when using Linux.
.IP SGI/XINET
Used by SGI machines when they mount HFS disks. Data fork stored
in a file.  Resource fork in subdirectory
.I .HSResource
with same filename.  Finder info as one record in file
.IR .HSancillary ".  Separate " .HSancillary
for each data fork directory.
.IP "Thursby Software Systems DAVE"
Allows Macintoshes to store Apple files on SMB servers.
Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork in subdirectory
.IR resource.frk .
Uses the AppleDouble format to store resource fork.
.IP "Services for Macintosh"
Format of files stored by NT Servers on NTFS filesystems. Data fork is
stored as
.IR filename .
Resource fork stored as a NTFS stream called
.IR filename:AFP_Resource .
The Finder info is stored as a NTFS stream called
.IR filename:Afp_AfpInfo .
NTFS streams are normally invisible to the user.
.IP
Warning:
.B genisoimage
only partially supports the SFM format. If an HFS file
or folder stored on the NT server contains an illegal
NT character in its name, NT converts these characters to
.I Private Use Unicode
characters.  The characters are: \(dq * / < > ? \(rs | and a space or
period if it is the last character of the filename, character codes 0x01
to 0x1f (control characters) and Apple's apple logo.
.IP
Unfortunately, these private Unicode characters are not readable by the
.B genisoimage
NT executable. Therefore any file or directory
name containing these characters will be ignored \(em including the contents of
any such directory.
.IP "Mac OS X AppleDouble"
When HFS/HFS+ files are copied or saved by Mac OS X on to a non-HFS
filesystem (e.g. UFS, NFS etc.), the files are stored in AppleDouble format.
Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork stored in a file with
same name prefixed with `._'. Finder info also stored in same `._' file.
.IP "Mac OS X HFS (Alpha)"
Not really an Apple/Unix encoding, but actual HFS/HFS+ files on a Mac\ OS\ X
system. Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork stored in a pseudo file
with the same name with the suffix
.IR /rsrc .
The Finder info is only available via a Mac OS X library call.
.IP
See also
.IR README.macosx .
.IP
Only works when used on Mac OS X.
.IP
If a file is found with a zero
length resource fork and empty finderinfo, it is assumed not to have
any Apple/Unix encoding \(em therefore a TYPE and CREATOR can be set using
other methods.
.PP
.B genisoimage
will attempt to set the CREATOR, TYPE, date and possibly other flags from
the finder info. Additionally, if it exists, the Macintosh filename is set
from the finder info, otherwise the Macintosh name is based on the Unix
filename \(em see the
.B HFS MACINTOSH FILENAMES
section below.
.PP
When using
.BR \-apple ,
the TYPE and CREATOR are stored in the optional System Use or
.I SUSP
field
in the ISO9660 Directory Record \(em in much the same way as the Rock Ridge
attributes are. In fact to make life easy, the Apple extensions are added
at the beginning of the existing Rock Ridge attributes (i.e., to get the Apple
extensions you get the Rock Ridge extensions as well).
.PP
The Apple extensions require the resource fork to be stored as an ISO9660
.I associated
file. This is just like any normal file stored in the ISO9660 filesystem
except that the associated file flag is set in the Directory Record (bit
2). This file has the same name as the data fork (the file seen by
non-Apple machines). Associated files are normally ignored by other OSs
.PP
When using
.BR \-hfs ,
the TYPE and CREATOR plus other finder info, are stored in a separate
HFS directory, not visible on the ISO9660 volume. The HFS directory references
the same data and resource fork files described above.
.PP
In most cases, it is better to use
.B \-hfs
instead of
.BR \-apple ,
as the latter imposes the limited ISO9660 characters allowed in
filenames. However, the Apple extensions do give the advantage that the
files are packed on the disk more efficiently and it may be possible to fit 
more files on a CD.
.\" ----------------------------------------
.SH "HFS MACINTOSH FILENAMES"
Where possible, the HFS filename that is stored with an Apple/Unix file
is used for the HFS part of the CD. However, not all the Apple/Unix
encodings store the HFS filename with the finderinfo. In these cases,
the Unix filename is used \(em with escaped special characters. Special
characters include `/' and characters with codes over 127.
.PP
AUFS escapes these characters by using `:' followed by the character code
as two hex digits. Netatalk and EtherShare have a similar scheme, but uses
`%' instead of a `:'.
.PP
If
.B genisoimage
cannot find an HFS filename, it uses the Unix name, with any
.IR %xx " or " :xx
characters
.RI ( xx
are two hex digits) converted to a single character code.  If
.I xx
are not hex digits ([0-9a-fA-F]), they are
left alone \(em although any remaining `:' is converted to `%', as `:'
is the HFS directory separator. Care must be taken, as an ordinary Unix
file with
.I %xx
or
.I :xx
will also be converted. e.g.
.PP
.TS
l l 
l s
l l
l s
l l .
This:2fFile	converted to This/File
	
This:File	converted to This%File
	
This:t7File	converted to This%t7File
.TE
.PP
Although HFS filenames appear to support uppercase and lowercase letters,
the filesystem is case-insensitive, i.e., the filenames
.IR aBc " and " AbC
are the same. If a file is found in a directory with the same HFS name,
.B genisoimage
will attempt to make a unique name by adding `_' characters
to one of the filenames. 
.PP
If an HFS filename exists for a file,
.B genisoimage
can use this name as the starting point for the ISO9660, Joliet and
Rock Ridge filenames using
.BR \-mac\-name .
Normal Unix files without an HFS name will still use their Unix name.
e.g.
.PP
If a MacBinary (or PC Exchange) file is stored as
.I someimage.gif.bin
on the Unix filesystem, but contains a HFS file called
.IR someimage.gif ,
this is the name that would appear on the HFS part of the CD. However, as
.B genisoimage
uses the Unix name as the starting point for the other names,
the ISO9660 name generated will probably be 
.I SOMEIMAG.BIN
and the Joliet/Rock Ridge would be
.IR someimage.gif.bin .
This option will use
the HFS filename as the starting point and the ISO9660 name will probably be
.I SOMEIMAG.GIF
and the Joliet/Rock Ridge would be
.IR someimage.gif .
.PP
.B \-mac\-name
will not currently work with
.B \-T
\(em the Unix name will be used in the
.I TRANS.TBL
file, not the Macintosh name.
.PP
The character set used to convert any HFS filename to a Joliet/Rock Ridge
filename defaults to
.I cp10000
(Mac Roman).
The character set used can be specified using
.BR \-input\-hfs\-charset .
Other built-in HFS character sets are:
.I cp10006
(MacGreek),
.I cp10007
(MacCyrillic),
.I cp10029
(MacLatin2),
.I cp10079
(MacIcelandandic) and
.I cp10081
(MacTurkish).
.PP
Note: the character codes used by HFS filenames taken from the various
Apple/Unix formats will not be converted as they are assumed to be in the
correct Apple character set. Only the Joliet/Rock Ridge names derived from
the HFS filenames will be converted.
.PP
The existing
.B genisoimage
code will filter out any illegal characters for the ISO9660 and Joliet
filenames, but as
.B genisoimage
expects to be dealing directly with Unix names, it leaves the Rock
Ridge names as is.  But as `/' is a legal HFS filename character,
.B \-mac\-name
converts `/' to a `_' in Rock Ridge filenames.
.PP
If the Apple extensions are used, only the ISO9660 filenames will
appear on the Macintosh. However, as the Macintosh ISO9660 drivers can use
.I Level 2
filenames, you can use options like
.B \-allow\-multidot
without problems on
a Macintosh \(em still take care over the names, for example
.I this.file.name
will be converted to
.I THIS.FILE
i.e. only have one `.', also filename
.I abcdefgh
will be seen as
.I ABCDEFGH
but
.I abcdefghi
will be seen as
.I ABCDEFGHI.
i.e. with a `.' at the end \(em don't know if this is a Macintosh
problem or a
.BR genisoimage / mkhybrid
problem. All filenames will be in uppercase
when viewed on a Macintosh. Of course, DOS/Win3.X machines will not be able
to see Level 2 filenames...
.\" ----------------------------------------
.SH "HFS CUSTOM VOLUME/FOLDER ICONS"
To give a HFS CD a custom icon, make sure the root (top level) folder includes
a standard Macintosh volume icon file. To give a volume a custom icon on
a Macintosh, an icon has to be pasted over the volume's icon in the "Get Info"
box of the volume. This creates an invisible file called
.I Icon\(rsr
(`\(rsr' is the carriage return character) in the root folder.
.P
A custom folder icon is very similar \(em an invisible file called
.I Icon\(rsr
exists in the folder itself.
.P
Probably the easiest way to create a custom icon that
.B genisoimage
can use is to format a blank HFS floppy disk on a Mac and paste an icon
to its "Get Info" box. If using Linux with the HFS module installed,
mount the floppy:
.IP
mount \-t hfs /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
.PP
The floppy will be mounted as a CAP filesystem by default.  Then run
.B genisoimage
using something like:
.IP
genisoimage \-\-cap \-o output source_dir /mnt/floppy
.PP
If you are not using Linux, you can use
.B hfsutils
to copy the icon file from the floppy.  However, care has to be taken,
as the icon file contains a control character.  For example:
.IP
hmount /dev/fd0
.br
hdir \-a
.br

.SH "HFS BOOT DRIVER"
It 
.I may
be possible to make the hybrid CD bootable on a Macintosh.
.PP
A bootable HFS CD requires an Apple CD-ROM (or compatible) driver, a bootable
HFS partition and the necessary System, Finder, etc. files.
.PP
A driver can be obtained from any other Macintosh bootable CD-ROM using the
.B apple_driver
utility. This file can then be used with
.BR \-boot\-hfs\-file .
.PP
The HFS partition (i.e. the hybrid disk in our case) must contain a
suitable System Folder, again from another CD-ROM or disk.
.PP
For a partition to be bootable, it must have its 
.I boot block
set. The boot
block is in the first two blocks of a partition. For a non-bootable partition
the boot block is full of zeros. Normally, when a System file is copied to
partition on a Macintosh disk, the boot block is filled with a number of
required settings \(em unfortunately I don't know the full spec for the boot
block, so I'm guessing that the following will work.
.PP
Therefore, the utility
.B apple_driver
also extracts the boot block from the
first HFS partition it finds on the given CD-ROM and this is used for the
HFS partition created by
.BR genisoimage .
.PP
.I Please note:
By using a driver from an Apple CD and copying Apple software to your CD,
you become liable to obey Apple Computer, Inc. Software License Agreements.
.\" ----------------------------------------
.SH "EL TORITO BOOT INFORMATION TABLE"
When
.B \-boot\-info\-table
is given,
.B genisoimage
will modify the boot file specified by
.B \-b
by inserting a 56-byte
.I boot information table
at offset 8 in
the file.  This modification is done in the source filesystem, so make
sure you use a copy if this file is not easily recreated!  This file
contains pointers which may not be easily or reliably obtained at boot
time.
.PP
The format of this table is as follows; all integers are in
section 7.3.1 ("little endian") format.
.sp
.RS +.2i
.ta 1.0i 2.5i 3.5i
.nf
Offset	Name	Size	Meaning
 8	bi_pvd	4 bytes	LBA of primary volume descriptor
12	bi_file	4 bytes	LBA of boot file
16	bi_length	4 bytes	Boot file length in bytes
20	bi_csum	4 bytes	32-bit checksum
24	bi_reserved	40 bytes	Reserved
.fi
.RE
.IP
The 32-bit checksum is the sum of all the 32-bit words in the boot
file starting at byte offset 64.  All linear block addresses (LBAs)
are given in CD sectors (normally 2048 bytes).
.\" ----------------------------------------
.SH "HPPA NOTES"
To make a bootable CD for HPPA, at the very least a boot loader file
.RB ( \-hppa\-bootloader ),
a kernel image file (32-bit, 64-bit, or both, depending on hardware)
and a boot command line
.RB ( \-hppa\-cmdline )
must be specified. Some systems can boot either a 32- or a 64-bit
kernel, and the firmware will choose one if both are present.
Optionally, a ramdisk can be used for the root filesystem using
.BR \-hppa\-cmdline .
.\" ----------------------------------------
.SH "JIGDO NOTES"
Jigdo is a tool to help in the distribution of large files like CD and
DVD images; see
.I http://atterer.org/jigdo/
for more details.  Debian CDs and DVD ISO
images are published on the web in jigdo format to allow end users to download
them more efficiently.
.PP
To create jigdo and template files alongside the ISO image from
.BR genisoimage ,
you must first generate a list of the files that will be
used, in the following format:
.sp
.RS +.2i
.ta 2.0i 2.0i 5.0i
.nf
MD5sum   File size  Path
32 chars 12 chars   to end of line
.fi
.RE
.IP
.PP
The MD5sum must be written in standard hexadecimal notation, the
file size must list the size of the file in bytes, and the path
must list the absolute path to the file. For example:
.sp
.nf
00006dcd58ff0756c36d2efae21be376         14736  /mirror/debian/file1
000635c69b254a1be8badcec3a8d05c1        211822  /mirror/debian/file2
00083436a3899a09633fc1026ef1e66e         22762  /mirror/debian/file3
.fi
.PP
Once you have this file, call
.B genisoimage
with all of your normal command-line parameters. Specify the output
filenames for the jigdo and template files using
.BR \-jigdo\-jigdo " and " \-jigdo\-template ,
and pass in the location of your MD5 list with
.BR \-md5\-list .
.PP
If there are files that you do NOT want to be added into the jigdo
file (e.g. if they are likely to change often), specify them using
\-jigdo\-exclude. If you want to verify some of the files as they are
written into the image, specify them using \-jigdo\-force\-md5. If any
files don't match,
.B genisoimage
will then abort.  Both of these options take
regular expressions as input. It is possible to restrict the set of
files that will be used further based on size \(em use the
\-jigdo\-min\-file\-size option.
.PP
Finally, the jigdo code needs to know how to map the files it is given
onto a mirror-style configuration. Specify how to map paths using
.BR \-jigdo\-map .
Using
.I Debian=/mirror/debian
will cause all
paths starting with
.I /mirror/debian
to be mapped to
.I Debian:<file>
in the output jigdo file.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To create a vanilla ISO9660 filesystem image in the file 
.IR cd.iso ,
where the directory
.I cd_dir
will become the root directory of the CD, call:
.IP
% genisoimage \-o cd.iso cd_dir
.PP
To create a CD with Rock Ridge extensions of
the source directory
.IR cd_dir :
.IP
% genisoimage \-o cd.iso \-R cd_dir
.PP
To create a CD with Rock Ridge extensions of
the source directory
.I cd_dir
where all files have at least read permission and all files
are owned by

To create a HFS hybrid CD from the source directory 
.I cd_dir
that contains
Netatalk Apple/Unix files:
.IP
% genisoimage \-o cd.iso \-\-netatalk cd_dir
.PP
To create a HFS hybrid CD from the source directory
.IR cd_dir ,
giving all files
CREATOR and TYPES based on just their filename extensions listed in the file 
"mapping".:
.IP
% genisoimage \-o cd.iso \-map mapping cd_dir
.PP
To create a CD with the Apple Extensions to ISO9660, from the source
directories
.I cd_dir
and
.IR another_dir .
Files in all the known Apple/Unix format
are decoded and any other files are given CREATOR and TYPE based on their
magic number given in the file
.IR magic :
.IP
% genisoimage \-o cd.iso \-apple \-magic magic \-probe \(rs
.br
        cd_dir another_dir
.PP
The following example puts different files on the CD that all have
the name README, but have different contents when seen as a
ISO9660/Rock Ridge, Joliet or HFS CD.
.PP
Current directory contains:
.IP
% ls \-F
.br
README.hfs     README.joliet  README.Unix    cd_dir/
.PP
The following command puts the contents of the directory
.I cd_dir
on the
CD along with the three README files \(em but only one will be seen from
each of the three filesystems:
.IP
% genisoimage \-o cd.iso \-hfs \-J \-r \-graft\-points \(rs
.br
        \-hide README.hfs \-hide README.joliet \(rs
.br
        \-hide\-joliet README.hfs \-hide\-joliet README.Unix \(rs
.br
        \-hide\-hfs README.joliet \-hide\-hfs README.Unix \(rs
.br
        README=README.hfs README=README.joliet \(rs
.br
        README=README.Unix cd_dir
.PP
i.e. the file README.hfs will be seen as README on the HFS CD and the
other two README files will be hidden. Similarly for the Joliet and
ISO9660/Rock Ridge CD.
.PP
There are probably all sorts of strange results possible with
combinations of the hide options ...
.\" ----------------------------------------
.SH NOTES
.PP
.B genisoimage
may safely be installed suid root. This may be needed to allow
.B genisoimage
to read the previous session when creating a multisession image.
.PP
If 
.B genisoimage 
is creating a filesystem image with Rock Ridge attributes and the
directory nesting level of the source directory tree is too much
for ISO9660, 
.B genisoimage 
will do deep directory relocation.
This results in a directory called
.B RR_MOVED
in the root directory of the CD. You cannot avoid this directory.
.PP
Many boot code options for different platforms are mutualy exclusive because
the boot blocks cannot coexist, ie. different platforms share the same data
locations in the image. See
http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/2006/12/msg00109.html for details.
.\" ----------------------------------------
.SH BUGS
.PP
Any files that have hard links to files not in the tree being copied to the
ISO9660 filesystem will have an incorrect file reference count.
.PP
Does not check for SUSP record(s) in `.' entry of the
root directory to verify the existence of Rock Ridge
enhancements.
This problem is present when reading old sessions while
adding data in multisession mode.
.PP
Does not properly read relocated directories in multisession
mode when adding data.
Any relocated deep directory is lost if the new session does not
include the deep directory.
.\" Repeat by: create first session with deep directory relocation
.\" then add new session with a single dir that differs from the
.\" old deep path.
.PP
Does not re-use
.I RR_MOVED
when doing multisession from
.IR TRANS.TBL .
.PP
Does not create whole_name entry for
.I RR_MOVED
in multisession mode.
.PP
There may be other bugs.  Please, report them to the maintainers.

.SH "HFS PROBLEMS/LIMITATIONS"
I have had to make several assumptions on how I expect the modified
libhfs routines to work, however there may be situations that either
I haven't thought of, or come across when these assumptions fail.
Therefore I can't guarantee that
.B genisoimage
will work as expected
(although I haven't had a major problem yet). Most of the HFS features work
fine, but some are not fully tested. These are marked as
.I Alpha
above.
.PP
Although HFS filenames appear to support uppercase and lowercase letters,
the filesystem is case-insensitive, i.e., the filenames
.IR aBc " and "AbC
are the same. If a file is found in a directory with the same HFS name,
.B genisoimage
will attempt to make a unique name by adding `_' characters
to one of the filenames.
.PP
HFS file/directory names that share the first 31 characters have
`_N' (a decimal number) substituted for the last few characters
to generate unique names.
.PP
Care must be taken when "grafting" Apple/Unix files or directories (see
above for the method and syntax involved). It is not possible to use a
new name for an Apple/Unix encoded file/directory. e.g. If a Apple/Unix
encoded file called
.I oldname
is to added to the CD, you cannot use the command line:
.IP
genisoimage \-o output.raw \-hfs \-graft\-points newname=oldname cd_dir
.PP
.B genisoimage
will be unable to decode
.IR oldname .
However, you can graft
Apple/Unix encoded files or directories as long as you do not attempt to
give them new names as above.
.PP
When creating an HFS volume with the multisession options,
.B \-M
and
.BR \-C ,
only files in the last session will be in the HFS volume. i.e.
.B genisoimage
cannot
.I add
existing files from previous sessions to the HFS volume.
.PP
However, if each session is created with
.BR \-part ,
each session will appear as 
separate volumes when mounted on a Mac. In this case, it is worth using
.BR \-V " or " \-hfs\-volid
to give each session a unique volume name,
otherwise each "volume" will appear on the Desktop with the same name.
.PP
Symbolic links (as with all other non-regular files) are not added to
the HFS directory.
.PP
Hybrid volumes may be larger than pure ISO9660 volumes
containing the same data. In some cases (e.g. DVD sized volumes) the
difference can be significant. As an HFS volume gets bigger, so does the
allocation block size (the smallest amount of space a file can occupy).
For a 650MB CD, the allocation block is 10kB, for a 4.7GB DVD it will be
about 70kB.
.PP
The maximum number of files in an HFS volume is about 65500 \(em although
the real limit will be somewhat less than this.
.PP
The resulting hybrid volume can be accessed on a Unix machine by using
the hfsutils routines. However, no changes can be made to the volume as it
is set as
.B locked.
The option
.B \-hfs\-unlock
will create an output image that is unlocked \(em however no changes should be
made to the contents of the volume (unless you really know what you are
doing) as it's not a "real" HFS volume.
.PP
.B \-mac\-name
will not currently work with
.B \-T
\(em the Unix name will be used in the
.I TRANS.TBL
file, not the Macintosh name.
.PP
Although 
.B genisoimage
does not alter the contents of a file, if a binary file has its TYPE
set as
.IR TEXT ", it " may
be read incorrectly on a Macintosh. Therefore a better choice for the
default TYPE may be
.IR ???? .
.PP
.B \-mac\-boot\-file
may not work at all...
.PP
May not work with PC Exchange v2.2 or higher files (available with MacOS 8.1).
DOS media containing PC Exchange files should be mounted as type
.B msdos
(not
.BR vfat )
when using Linux.
.PP
The SFM format is only partially supported \(em see
.B HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS
section above.
.PP
It is not possible to use
.BR \-sparc\-boot " or " \-generic\-boot " with"
.BR \-boot\-hfs\-file " or " \-prep\-boot .
.PP
.B genisoimage
should be able to create HFS hybrid images over 4Gb, although this has not
been fully tested.
