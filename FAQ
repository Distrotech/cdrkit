Frequently Asked Questions about cdrkit
=======================================

Q: What does "wodim" stand for?
A: It is not a forest troll and not a winner of the inpronounceability
   contest. It was simply the next alternative to wom (Writes Optical Media)
   which was unfortunately already used by other software products.

Q: What this name of ... mean?
A: Terminology: some names are based on pure imagination, some on
   abbreviations, some on permutations of chars in descriptions.

      genisoimage: Generate ISO IMAGEs
      icedax: InCrEdible Audio eXtractor
      librols: LIB Remains Of LibSchily
      libusal: LIB Unified/Universal Scsi Access Layer
      netscsid: NET SCSI Daemon
      readom: READ Optical Media (see also wodim)
      wodim: see above

Q: Are there additional depedencies, compared to cdrtools?
A: Yes. Libcap is required on Linux plattform. Libmagic is needed to support
   content-based creator/type tables with HFS (optional). Libiconv is needed to
   support iconv-based filename converstion, eg. from UTF-8 ins Joliet's UCS-2
   unicode (optional, on plattform where iconv is not already included in the libc
   system library).

Q: Burning dies with (logical unit communication crc error (ultra-dma/32)).
   Reason? Solutions?
A: Try enabling DMA for your device. Some CDROM readers/writters seem to send
   non-critical UDMA control/error codes without beeing in DMA mode and so
   those messages are not interpreted by the kernel but delivered to the
   applications instead.
