Frequently Asked Questions about cdrkit
=======================================

Q: What does "wodim" stand for?
A: It is not a forest troll and not a winner of the inpronounceability
   contest. It was simply the next alternative to wom (Writes Optical Media)
   which was unfortunately already used by other software products.

Q: Are there additional depedencies, compared to cdrtools?
A: Yes. Libcap is required on Linux plattform. Libmagic is needed to support
content-based creator/type tables with HFS (optional). Libiconv is needed to
support iconv-based filename converstion, eg. from UTF-8 ins Joliet's UCS-2
unicode (optional, on plattform where iconv is not already included in the libc
system library).
