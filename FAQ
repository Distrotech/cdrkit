Frequently Asked Questions about cdrkit
=======================================

Q: What does "wodim" stand for?
A: It is not a forest troll and not a winner of the inpronounceability
   contest. It was simply the next alternative to wom (Writes Optical Media)
   which was unfortunately already used by other software products.

Q: Are there additional depedencies, compared to cdrtools?
A: Yes. Libcap is required on Linux plattform. Libmagic is needed to support
   content-based creator/type tables with HFS (optional). Libiconv is needed to
   support iconv-based filename converstion, eg. from UTF-8 ins Joliet's UCS-2
   unicode (optional, on plattform where iconv is not already included in the libc
   system library).

Q: Why those annoying messages? Can you not remove them?
A: Joerg Schilling wants you to see those messages. He has embedded them into
   the source and "protected" them from removal by additional license
   restrictions. Any attempts to get a clarification on the issues failed. We
   got some "answers" but most have been unrelated and/or just drawing the
   attention away from the relevant questions. We cannot make decissions
   without new and relevant information, no matter how often Joerg Schilling
   claims that there are no problems with his licensing.
   Therefore we have to assume that the license is not GPL but something called
   Shily-GPL, beeing based GPL but enriched with additional terms
   (restrictions) spread in the source files without attracting attention.

Q: Why not just remove or disable them?
A: Relevant license restrictions say "you are not allowed" to "modify" or "remove"
   the "... printing". Disabling the printing by technical means is not much
   different to removing the stuff, so dealing with that problem on technical
   level is not the right thing.
