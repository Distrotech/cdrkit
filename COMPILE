Short overview for those who don't read manuals:

This software is compiled to binary form using a build system based on the
CMake framework. Therefore, the requirements to build this package are:

 - cmake (revent version, available from http://www.cmake.org or maybe as a
   package in system's Linux distribution)
 - make (an implmentation supported by cmake, eg. GNU make, smake, ...)
 - working GCC compiler environment

INSTALLATION:

Run:

cmake .
make install

(you can append DESTDIR=/alternative/root to install into a different location)
