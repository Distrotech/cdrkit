Copyright:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* cdrecord -- Record data on a CD-Recorder
  Copyright (c) 1995-2004 J. Schilling
  License: GPLv2 with the following additional requirement:
-       You may not modify certain copyright messages in cdrecord.c
        See cdrecord.c for further information.

-       You may (with a few exceptions) not modify the location of the
        configuration file /etc/default/cdrecord.
        See defaults.c for further information.

cdrecord.c says (but see below):
------------------------------------------
|   Warning: you are not allowed to modify or to remove the
|   Copyright and version printing code below!
|   See also GPL § 2 subclause c)
|  
|   If you modify cdrecord you need to include additional version
|   printing code that:
|  
|  	-	Clearly states that the current version is an
|  		inofficial (modified) version and thus may have bugs
|  		that are not present in the original.
|  
|  	-	Print your support e-mail address and tell people that
|  		you will do complete support for this version of
|  		cdrecord.
|  
|  		Or clearly state that there is absolutely no support
|  		for the modified version you did create.
|  
|  	-	Tell the users not to ask the original author for
|  		help.
|  
|   This limitation definitely also applies when you use any other
|   cdrecord release together with libscg-0.6 or later, or when you
|   use any amount of code from cdrecord-1.11a17 or later.
|   In fact, it applies to any version of cdrecord, see also
|   GPL Preamble, subsection 6.
|  
|   I am sorry for the inconvenience but I am forced to do this because
|   some people create inofficial branches. These branches create
|   problems but the initiators do not give support and thus cause the
|   development of the official cdrecord versions to slow down because
|   I am loaded with unneeded work.
|  
|   Please note that this is a memorandum on how I interpret the GPL.
|   If you use/modify/redistribute cdrecord, you need to accept it
|   this way.
|   
|  
|   The above statement is void if there has been neither a new version
|   of cdrecord nor a new version of star from the original author
|   within more then a year.

For that Andreas Metzler had a mail conversation with Joerg, the last
and important mail is included below, except an unrelated part I
removed. It's in German, translation follows after the original mail.

Darf geaendert werden. und ich habe auch absichtlich ein "Loch" gelassen, so
dasz jemand den uname() Test mit einem automatischen Patch versehen kann.

And now the English translation of the mail above. Only content:
------------------------------------------------------------
Andreas asks:
Let me ask again: linuxcheck() is not restricted with
"you are not allowed to modify or to remove the Copyright and version
printing code below!"?

Jörg answers:
It is allowed to change this and I have a "gap" there intentionally, so
one can change the uname() check with an automated patch.
------------------------------------------------------------

Thats not a Debian-specific license and it only leaves the version
printing stuff in cdrecord.c. Which is allowed from GPL.

defaults.c says:
------------------------------------------
 | WARNING you are only allowed to change this filename if you also
 | change the documentation and add a statement that makes clear
 | where the official location of the file is why you did choose a
 | nonstandard location and that the nonstandard location only refers
 | to unofficial cdrecord versions.
 |
 | I was forced to add this because some people change cdrecord without
 | rational reason and then publish the result. As those people
 | don't contribute work and don't give support, they are causing extra
 | work for me and this way slow down the cdrecord development.
