cdrkit (5:1.0-1) unstable; urgency=high

  [ Eduard Bloch ]
  * ATAPI -> ATA mapping and better error messages (closes: #398465)
  * more reliable FIFO process termination (closes: #398043)
  * prints burn-free message only with higher verbosity (closes: 388770)
  * sorted file list printing, by Dennis Vshivkov (closes: #278071)

  [ Joerg Jaspert ]
  *  Remove all the printing of useless messages. This is based on GPLed
     code, so we follow the letter of the GPL as it is interpreted by 99%
     of the world, including its authors. Especially as Joerg was never able
     to give us any clear explanation what other license he may think
     cdrtools had, despite us asking multiple times. So we have no other
     choice than to take whats written down, and thats GPL.
  * The above fixes "license needs to be clarified" as well as
    "Cdrkit possibly made non-free by former upstream, refuses
    clarification"(Closes: #387783, #392342).
    Note that I do not remove the "You may not return schily" clauses.
    They are, in my understanding, valid requests an upstream can make, not
    including his name if he doesn't want it. They are also no problem for
    anyone, anywhere, the other stuff was.
  * Was included earlier, close Bug "diff for 5:1.0~pre4-1.1 NMU" (Closes: #388595).
  * Bug fix: "wodim: Spelling error in output of -checkdrive", thanks to
    Alexey Feldgendler (Closes: #389135).
  * Urgency high.

cdrkit (5:1.0~pre2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restored the build system of zisofs-tools and changed to its use in
    debian/rules. It is a separate project with a mature build system while
    the replacement would need improvements to keep up.

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Sep 2006 01:24:22 +0200

cdrkit (5:1.0~pre1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Eduard Bloch ]
  * dropped the shm build (kernel 2.2 is history)
  * dropped dpatch integration, we are the upstream now
  * disabled debconf messages and device-creating code for now
    (closes: #326138, #314139); things like hints to create device files are
    essential for only few people and can equaly be presented as program
    messages. Why shall we still MAKEDEV them?  It's not like we have switched
    to kernel 2.0.1 yesterday (closes: #342085, #188827, #200665)
  * updated Build-Dependencies for kfreebsd (closes: #355291)
  * debian/copyright got uptodate mail address for Schilling (closes: #372484)

  [ Eduard Bloch, upstream related changes ] 
  * The Big Fork to an independent project called cdrkit
    + using the last clearly stated GPLed versions of files from
      cdrtools-2.01.01a08 (closes: #353403, #372486)
    + we play the upstream role now, using our patches and we like them
      (closes: #361450)
    + renamed relevant works to avoid claims of "potential defamation" or
      "damage of reputation" (closes: #350738)
    + custom CMake based build system used instead of the original one, since
      we understand it better (closes: #350739 and hopefully closes: #350254,
      reopen if not). It seems to be portable among the platforms
      supported by Debian, it needs a bit of work for porting to non-Linux
      plattforms, though.
  * removed most of the anti-linux2.6  program messages (unless being
    in verbose mode). (closes: #377145)
  * changed default config file location to /etc/default/wodim
  * added more meaningful error message on -dvd-video failure (closes: #324586)
  * minor cdda2mp3/cdda2ogg scripts fixes suggested by Fabian Pietsch, plus
    fixes for unreliable encoder detection (closes: #283794, #344443) plus
    possible override of preset CDDA_DEVICE variable fixed. Made the list of
    selected audiotracks modifiable, see manpage (closes: #344445)
  * sync with 4:2.01+01a01-4ubuntu4:
    + merged README.ATAPI.setup with README.ATAPI.setup.ubuntu. Kernel 2.6 part
      now in the beginning and reflecting the reality (dev=/dev/drive syntax,
      no SUID requirement, closes: #304230, #377736)
    + 02_cdrecord_default_conf.dpatch: changed /dev/cdrom to /dev/cdrw which
      is more likely to match the correct device on udev using systems
  * 36_ATA_scanbus_ignore_locked.dpatch to ignore busy devices (eg. hda
    harddisk) while scanning with dev=ATA 
    (closes: #310689, #309250, #317793, #360295, 
  * Included 37_clean_dvdsup.dpatch (closes: #312062) based on
    cdrtools-2.01.01a04-dvd.patch.bz2 from
    http://people.mandriva.com/~warly/files/cdrtools/ with few updates to work
    with a08. Also implements a fallback to ATA: bus in the -scanbus operation
    (closes: #310689, #278894). This patch is used instead of the old 07_....
    Enabled permanently, disabled the "cheatcode processing" in debian/rules.
    Also eliminates some useability problems that have been pushed to our
    users (closes: #325766, #271114, #312062, #353176).
  * Updated dirsplit to version 0.3.3, zisofs-tools to 1.0.7 (with a custom
    CMakeFile.txt for easier integration and config.h updated manually for
    now)
  * minor cdda2mp3/cdda2ogg scripts fixes suggested by Fabian Pietsch, plus
    fixes for unreliable encoder detection (closes: #283794, #344443) plus
    possible override of preset CDDA_DEVICE variable fixed
  * added additional script manpages from Oleksandr Moskalenko (closes: #295438)
  * changed -speed to speed= in cdrecord.1 for consistency (closes: #344214)
  * Anti-Root-Requirements:
    + 39_nonroot_skips_rezero_unit.dpatch - don't run rezero_unit() as root
    which is a) most likely not needed (even admited in the comment) and b)
    causes the whole scsi transport system to terminate
    + 40_stop_setuid_games.dpatch - another workaround for problems introduced
    in a03 - looks like Linux kernel does reject an application trying to
    change the UID between ioctls
    (closes: #335253, #374685, #330506, #329308, #374345, #377421)
  * Ubuntu's 40_fix_bad_spelling.dpatch integrated (typo in wodim.dfl)
  * increased hash size in mkisofs/hash.c (closes: #327270)
  * more decent info message about locale detection

  [ Joerg Jaspert]:
  * Make build-depends on cmake versioned, to show backporters we need a recent one.
  * Bump build-depends on debhelper.
  * Kill old conflict on xcdroast, that version is no longer in Debian
  * Added a dummy cdrecord package to ease upgrades for our users. Will get removed
    some time after etch released.
  * Cleaned debian/rules a bit.
  * wodim.links: s/cdrecord/wodim/
  * Let cdrkitt-doc conflict/replace old cdrtools-doc
  * Cleaned up postinst for wodim and removed makedev dependency.

  * No more debconf (Closes: #361776, #379992, #381954)

  * (closes: #123111) - cdda2wav doesn't fail properly. Looks like it
    returns a 1 now.
  * Changed Priority to match with override file.
  * Modified 03_script.dpatch. Now cdda2mp3 and cdda2ogg only using
    /etc/default/cdda2* if it is there. cdda2mp3 now also fails if
    selected encoder is not available (like cdda2ogg already does).
    Also set CDDA_DEVICE in both scripts if not already set.
    (closes: #163076)
  * Removed cdrecord-dev package. Not used anywhere.
  * Dropped Provides, Replaces to mkhybrid from mkisofs.
    Its gone since woody, we dont need it any longer.
  * (closes: #143786) - /etc/cdrecord.conf ignored.
    Only if you upgrade from a pre-woody package. There was an error with
    the location. If you upgrade directly from pre-woody then mv the file
    to /etc/default/cdrecord (or add your changes there).
  * Ok ok, use a symlink for /etc/cdrecord/* and not a hardlink.
    (closes: #170302)
  * (closes: #169932) - cdda2wav: cd-text problems
    Tested on 2 different systems - cdtext burn and read works. (use last
    example from cdrecord manpage for it). Use the sg driver, not atapi
    for it.

  * New Maintainer. Thx to Michael Stone (former Maintainer) and to
    Eduard Bloch for his NMU's. Thx also to Andreas Metzler who did (outside of
    Debian Archive) work on cdrtools Package, some of which I included here.
  	Andreas and Eduard helping me as Co-Maintainers.
  	This closes all NMU fixed bugs:
  	(closes: #162027, #161502, #161689, #159830)
  * New upstream release
    (closes: #163041) - cdrecord: Input/output errors when burning CDs
    (closes: #165745) - cdrecord: Copyright problems - libedc used in 1.11a34 is
                        non-free
    (closes: #161070) - cdrecord: when cdrecord is stopped by Ctrl-C in dummy
                        burning mode, asus 1610A is blocked
    (closes: #168635) - cdrecord: Typo in man page    
    (closes: #162579) - mkisofs: isoinfo does not accept coalesced options any
                        more. That was always an user error. It works as
                        documented now.
    (closes: #165015) - cdrtools: Patch to work with 2.5.43. (Read AN-1.11a38)
  * finally completely GPL (including libedc!)
  * Update debian/copyright.
  * Don't mention DVD-writing in description (Closes: #162660)
  * Removed 01_cdr_gnuisms. gcc defines __linux__, __linux and linux,
    so we dont need to patch it that way (and linux is not POSIX
    compliant (even if it is defined), __linux__ is)
  * Upstream includes ia64 rules, delete that patch.
  * We now have smake in the Archive. Build-Depend on that, because it is
    the make-system Upstream really supports for his packages. (And with it
    we never need to include a patch for missing rules-files again, it creates
    them automagically)    
  * Include a symlink from /etc/cdrecord/* to /etc/default/*, (closes: #159506)
    That makes it easy to find the cdrecord config and still is compatible with
    upstream *and self-compiled* versions of cdr-tools.
  * Removed 03-cdr-mmap patch and use -DUSE_USGSHM in COPTX - it can be so simple
    to be compatible with old kernels.
  * Make cdrecord only executable for users in the cdrom group (mode 4750)
    if it set SUID (Closes: #164283)
  * Updated to 3.5.7.1 standards version.
  * Do not strip options/commandline out of iso-files. That is *NO* security
    risk. It only contains the options used to create the isofile and the name
    of the directory you created the iso (path is truncated to ../) of it.
  * Drop dbs from Build-Depends, use dpatch system.
  * patch to get silo bootable cds will be deleted with next Upstream
    release of cdrtools. Ben wants to fix silo, but as always: patches
    are welcome, we are all low on time. If you use sparc and want
    bootable linux cd's - go on and send patches for silo please. Look
    into README.silo in /usr/share/doc/mkisofs for more details.

cdrtools (4:1.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move to cdrecord 1.10 final version (closes: #93125, #97219)
  * Make sure /dev/sg0 is a char and /dev/scd0 is a block dev 
    (closes: #93592, #92836)
  * Make sure that if cdrecord is compiled under 2.4.x that folks 
    running 2.2.x get informed they must recompile.
    (closes: #92927, #92949, #93001, #93281, #96832, #95622)
  * Add in man page for readcd (closes: #93772)
  * cdrecord supports Disc at Once and Track at Once modes 
    these days (closes: #69308)
  * Linux 2.4.x kernels use shmfs these days, so alpha boxes should
    be taken care of now (closes: #67995)
  * Newer kernels should no longer crash (closes: #71746)
  * Include some german docs, submitted by Eduard Bloch <edi@gmx.de>
  * Those wanting cdrecord to be setuid root, or similar, can use
    the dpkg-statoverride utility provided by dpkg. (closes: #78505)
  * Added ia64 support (RULES/ia64*) from Bdale <bdale@itanium.gag.com>
    (closes: #100858)

    mkisofs symlink tree support (closes: #85672)
  * If upstream feels it is best to write args to CD, I'm not going 
    to argue with him.  (closes: #87043)

  * Removed cruft from changelog (closes: #90499)
  * manpage bad escape sequence fixed and sent upstream (closes: #82815)
  * Joerg Schilling is German.  The English word "Identification" is spelled
    "Identifikation" in German, and so he is not going to change it.  Besides,
    changing it would break gcombust, xcdrecord, etc.  (closes: #69945)

cdrecord (3:1.8-3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Included the fixed linux scsi driver from 1.8.1 -- the previous release
    has a bug causing CD's to fail to fixate properly. This fixes an 
    important bug, and so should go into frozen.  (closes: #62855)
  * Group "cdrom" always exists on a Debian system (closes: #63058)
  * Cdrecord doesn't even refer to root in the postinst (closes: #59763)
  * Cdrecord now uses suidregister.  Cdrecord is still installed 0755, but 
    now those foolish enough to want to make it suid root can do so on their 
    own systems.  (closes: #61899)
  * Many thanks to Torsten Landschoff <torsten@debian.org> for his help
    on this release.

  * Fixed a release critical bug for potato where the postinst 
      script called the /dev/MAKEDEV symlink, instead of /sbin/MAKEDEV, 
      but the /dev/MAKEDEV symlink is not there till makdev is configured. 
      (closes: #55694)

  * Fixed all important lintian errors and warnings.
  * cdrecord is not designed to be setuid, and has never
    been audited for such a task.  Folks wanting non-root
    to use cdrecord, should be able to set perms on /dev/sg*
    (closes: #38711)
  * cdda2wav --help seems to work these days. (closes: #41663)
  * I found a 7 track cd "Heifetz Concertos -- Tchaikovsky, Mendelssohn",

    well as mkisofs, cdda2wav, and cdrecord-dev.  They used to all be 
    built from separate sources.
  * I now check for the existance of the needed /dev/sg?? devices, and if
    they are not there (as seems to be the case for a stock Debian 2.1
    install), I go ahead and make these devices.
