 - add README.ATAPI.setup, rewrotten by me (a07 branch) or from Ubuntu people
 - the align.h and avoffset.h generation in libschilly/CMakeLists.txt is a cludge and triggers unneccessary rebuilds too often. Solution: use CONFIGURE_FILE and replace @VAR@ with values detected with CHECK_TYPE_SIZE, then trough the Schilling's generator away
 - Implement generation of cdda2wav/lconfig.h or just replace with cmake macros
 - add buildstuff for the doc directory? Any need?
 - Check the readmes. Drop obsolete instructions.
 - Same for the manpages. Adapt to current facts, rename cdrecord to... wodim?
 - some cdda2wav defined moved from the ueber-long command line to lconfig.h , make them configurable
 - is there really no distclean rule? Check that and maybe remove the cludge in GNUmakefile
 - find and eliminate remaining ".mk" ".mk*" files
