 - Check the readmes. Drop obsolete instructions.
 - some cdda2wav defined moved from the ueber-long command line to lconfig.h ,
   make them configurable. Implement generation of cdda2wav/lconfig.h or just
   replace with cmake macros
 - add better detection for various functions. Eg. correct checks for have_soundcard, have_mlockall and have_wait_h for cygwin.
 - add buildstuff for the doc directory? Any need?
 - find and eliminate remaining ".mk" ".mk*" files
- The AUTHOR sections of scgcheck/scgcheck.1, btcflash/btcflash.1 have
  a number of URLs and mailing lists all pointing to Schilling.
  I suggest to add hints to the debian fork there too.

- Can we rename the 'cdrecord' directory into 'wodim'?
  That may be hard on the build system, this could be the best time
  to change it.
