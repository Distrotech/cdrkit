 - Check the readmes. Drop obsolete instructions. (assigned to: ???)
 - check libparanoia, we may link dynamicaly with it. Quality? Portability?
 - POSIX checks for sys/wait.h rather than pure existence check
 - proper getnameinfo/inet_ntoa checks, see include/CMakeLists.txt
 - find out why spawn.c breaks in WAIT_H while the WAIT_UNION check works quite well on sys/wait.h. See include/CMakeLists.txt comments.
 - rewrite or drop fconv.c, it does not compile on AIX, missing isnan symbol. Or link libm, as alternative.
 - check notes in help output, drop advisories, notes about future plans...
 - some cdda2wav defined moved from the ueber-long command line to lconfig.h ,
   make them configurable. Implement generation of cdda2wav/lconfig.h or just
   replace with cmake macros (assigned to: ???)
 - add better detection for various functions. Eg. correct checks for have_soundcard, have_mlockall for cygwin. (volunteers?)
 - see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=cdrkit and try to solve upstream related problems
 - find and eliminate remaining ".mk" ".mk*" files (where? cleanup branch)
 - make some deflt.h functions inline, use a define wrapper INLINE which is set
   if the compiler does not support it
 - Can we rename the 'cdrecord' directory into 'wodim'?
 That may be hard on the build system, this could be the best time to change
 it. (No, it isn't hard. Just needs a good moment to settle down everything and
 then rename. EB.)

 - implement -stream-file-name. Then close #157962
