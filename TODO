 - check the REMOTE method, especially with real device names and ssh.
   Something is going wrong.
   OR
   Stop supporting it, add a warning to libusal (scsi-remote.c or so) to not
   use it, add an appropriate comment to a BUGS file
 - try again with FIND_LIBRARY(iconv_open,libiconv),
   FIND_LIBRARY(iconv_open,c), FIND_LIBRARY(gethostbyname,xnet),
   FIND_LIBRARY(gethostbyname,nls), FIND_LIBRARY(gethostbyname,c) (in that order?!)
   Shall work on AIX or BSD and on Cygwin
 - disable boot-mipsel with non-GCC?
 - fix nread() callers, see toc.c:835
 - check libparanoia, we may link dynamicaly with it. Quality? Portability?
 - check documentation, debian/* documentation, FAQ, etc.pp.
 - proper getnameinfo/inet_ntoa checks, see include/CMakeLists.txt
 - check notes in help output, drop advisories, notes about future plans...
 - find out why spawn.c breaks in WAIT_H while the WAIT_UNION check works quite well on sys/wait.h. See include/CMakeLists.txt comments.
 - add better detection for various functions. Eg. have_mlockall on cygwin. (volunteers?)
 - wodim -audio wavefile thesamewavefile thesamewavefile fails with obscure
   symptoms. Why?
 - make some deflt.h functions inline, use a define wrapper INLINE which is set
   if the compiler does not support it
 - review the sort/uniq code in dvd_file.c, see comments there
 - implement -stream-file-name. Then close #157962
