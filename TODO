 - Check the readmes. Drop obsolete instructions.
 - some cdda2wav defined moved from the ueber-long command line to lconfig.h ,
   make them configurable. Implement generation of cdda2wav/lconfig.h or just
   replace with cmake macros
 - add better detection for various functions. Eg. correct checks for have_soundcard, have_mlockall and have_wait_h for cygwin.
 - add buildstuff for the doc directory? Any need?
 - see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=cdrkit and try to solve upstream related problems
 - find and eliminate remaining ".mk" ".mk*" files
 - Can we rename the 'cdrecord' directory into 'wodim'?
 That may be hard on the build system, this could be the best time
 to change it.
