 - Check the readmes. Drop obsolete instructions. (assigned to: ???)
 - check notes in help output, drop advisories, notes about future plans...
 - some cdda2wav defined moved from the ueber-long command line to lconfig.h ,
   make them configurable. Implement generation of cdda2wav/lconfig.h or just
   replace with cmake macros (assigned to: ???)
 - add better detection for various functions. Eg. correct checks for have_soundcard, have_mlockall and have_wait_h for cygwin. (volunteers?)
 - see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=cdrkit and try to solve upstream related problems
 - find and eliminate remaining ".mk" ".mk*" files (where? cleanup branch)
 - Can we rename the 'cdrecord' directory into 'wodim'?
 That may be hard on the build system, this could be the best time
 to change it.
