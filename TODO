1.0.x
  - find a good name for cdda2wav, follow the wodim procedure
  - fix lorinder's bug
  - check documentation, debian/* documentation, FAQ, etc.pp.
  - fix DVD-RW support (DVD+RW works, though, DVD-RW blanking works too)
  - fix dirsplit -S, looses files

1.1.x

 - check libparanoia, we may link dynamicaly with it. Quality? Portability?
 - proper getnameinfo/inet_ntoa checks, see include/CMakeLists.txt
 - find out why spawn.c breaks in WAIT_H while the WAIT_UNION check works quite well on sys/wait.h. See include/CMakeLists.txt comments.
 - check notes in help output, drop advisories, notes about future plans...
 - add better detection for various functions. Eg. have_mlockall on cygwin. (volunteers?)
 - wodim -audio wavefile thesamewavefile thesamewavefile fails with obscure
   symptoms. Why?
 - see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=cdrkit and try to solve upstream related problems
 - find and eliminate remaining ".mk" ".mk*" files (where? cleanup branch)
 - make some deflt.h functions inline, use a define wrapper INLINE which is set
   if the compiler does not support it
 - review the sort/uniq code in dvd_file.c, see comments there
 - Can we rename the 'cdrecord' directory into 'wodim'?
 That may be hard on the build system, this could be the best time to change
 it. (No, it isn't hard. Just needs a good moment to settle down everything and
 then rename. EB.)

 - implement -stream-file-name. Then close #157962
