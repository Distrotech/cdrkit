 - fix the multi-file in cuefile support at all. First idea:
   import libcuefile from on cuetools-1.3.1/src/lib (after generating the
   parser with its build system), add CMakeLists.txt, drop cue.c and make wodim
   make use of the parsed CUE data if available.
   But be warned, JS said something about bugs in cuetools code, a proper test
   suite is required. I doubt he will share his test cases.

   Maybe even do it properly and create a track writting strategy preprocessor
   module which could be feeded from cue/toc or from CLI options.
   But OTOH this is similar to what libburnia is going to make real, spare time
   is better invested there.

 - check the REMOTE method, especially with real device names and ssh.
   Something is going wrong.
   OR
   Stop supporting it, add a warning to libusal (scsi-remote.c or so) to not
   use it, add an appropriate comment to a BUGS file
 - fix nread() callers, see toc.c:835
 - check libparanoia, we may link dynamicaly with it. Quality? Portability?
 - check notes in help output, drop advisories, notes about future plans...
 - find out why spawn.c breaks in WAIT_H while the WAIT_UNION check works quite well on sys/wait.h. See include/CMakeLists.txt comments.
 - add better detection for various functions. Eg. have_mlockall on cygwin. (volunteers?)
 - wodim -audio wavefile thesamewavefile thesamewavefile fails with obscure
   symptoms. Why?
 - make some deflt.h functions inline, use a define wrapper INLINE which is set
   if the compiler does not support it
 - review the sort/uniq code in dvd_file.c, see comments there
 - implement -stream-file-name. Then close #157962
