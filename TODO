 - add buildstuff for the doc directory? Any need?
 - Check the readmes. Drop obsolete instructions.
 - Same for the manpages. Adapt to current facts, rename cdrecord to... wodim?
 - Implement generation of cdda2wav/lconfig.h or just replace with cmake macros
 - some cdda2wav defined moved from the ueber-long command line to lconfig.h , make them configurable
 - is there really no distclean rule? Check that and maybe remove the cludge in GNUmakefile
 - find and eliminate remaining ".mk" ".mk*" files
