.TH MKZFTREE "1" "30 July 2001" "zisofs-tools" "H. Peter Anvin"
.SH NAME
mkzftree \- Create a zisofs/RockRidge compressed file tree
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkzftree
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]... \fIINPUT\fR \fIOUTPUT\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Takes an input file tree (\fIINPUT\fR) and create a corresponding
compressed file tree (\fIOUTPUT\fR) that can be used with an
appropriately patched
.BR mkisofs (8)
to create a transparent-compression ISO 9660/Rock Ridge filesystem using
the "ZF" compression records.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-force\fP
Always compress all files, even if they get larger when compressed.
.TP
\fB\-z\fP \fIlevel\fP, \fB\-\-level\fP \fIlevel\fP
Select compression level (1-9, default is 9).  Lower compression
levels are faster, but typically result in larger output.
.TP
\fB\-u\fP, \fB\-\-uncompress\fP
Uncompress an already compressed tree.  This can be used to read a
compressed filesystem on a system which cannot read them natively.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP \fIparallelism\fP, \fB\-\-parallelism\fP \fIparallelism\fP
Compress in parallel.  The
.I parallelism
value indicates how many compression threads are allowed to run.
.TP
\fB\-x\fP, \fB\-\-one-filesystem\fP
Do not cross filesystem boundaries, but create directory stubs at
mount points.
.TP
\fB\-X\fP, \fB\-\-strict-one-filesystem\fP
Do not cross filesystem boundaries, and do not create directory stubs
at mount points.
.TP
\fB\-C\fP \fIpath\fP, \fB\-\-crib-path\fP \fIpath\fP
Steal ("crib") files from another directory if it looks (based on
name, size, type and modification time) like they match entries in the
new filesystem.  The "crib tree" is usually the compressed version of
an older version of the same workload; this thus allows for
"incremental rebuilds" of a compressed filesystem tree.  The files are
hardlinked from the crib tree to the output tree, so if it is
desirable to keep the link count correct the crib path should be
deleted before running \fBmkisofs\fP.  The crib tree must be on the
same filesystem as the output tree.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP, \fB\-\-local\fP
Do not recurse into subdirectories, but create the directories
themselves.
.TP
\fB\-L\fP, \fB\-\-strict-local\fP
Do not recurse into subdirectories, and do not create directories.
.TP
\fB\-F\fP, \fB\-\-file\fP
Indicates that \fIINPUT\fP may not necessarily be a directory; this
allows operation on a single file.  Note especially that if \fI\-F\fP
is specified, and \fIINPUT\fP is a symlink, the symlink itself will be
copied rather than whatever it happens to point to.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP, \fB\-\-sloppy\fP
Treat file modes, times and ownership data as less than precious
information and don't abort if they cannot be set.  This may be useful
if running
.B mkisofs
on an input tree you do not own.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP
Increase the program verbosity.
.TP
\fB\-V\fP \fIvalue\fP, \fB\-\-verbosity\fP \fIvalue\fP
Set the program verbosity to
.IR value .
.TP
\fB\-q\fP, \fB\-\-quiet\fP
Issue no messages whatsoever, including error messages.  This is the same
as specifying
.IR "\-V\ 0" .
.TP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
Display a brief help message.
.TP
\fB\-w\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
Display the release version.
.SH BUGS
Long options (beginning with \fI\-\-\fP) may not work on all systems.
See the message printed out by \fImkzftree\ \-h\fP to see if this
applies to your system.
.PP
Inode change times (ctimes) are not copied.  This is a system
limitation and applies to all file copy programs.
.PP
If using the parallel option (\fI\-z\fP) the access times (atimes) on
directories may or may not be copied.  If it is important that the
atimes on directories are copied exactly, avoid using \fI\-z\fP.
