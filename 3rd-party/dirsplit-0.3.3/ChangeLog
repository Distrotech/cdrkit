*0.3.3: 2006/03

* code refactoring, much more readable now
* dropped the "du" exploration mode
* dropped the read-from-file mode and input "correct" cludge
	* Use the new -T option to specify arbitrary input, and avoid dupes.
	* Use the new option -F to follow symlinks
* option name fixes
* new option simple/stupid mode
	* no space-efficiency optimisation, instead trying to store in alphabetic
	  order

0.3.2:

* cosmetic, correct usage and long help

0.3.1:

* proper fix for the = filenames

0.3:

* rewrite of some data input code, now using internal directory scanning
(exploration) go get data, not trusting du -a crap
* estimative calculation for filesystem overhead for directory entries
* workaround for = in filenames
* much, much more
