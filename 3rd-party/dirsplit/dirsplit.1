.SH NAME
dirsplit \- splits directory into multiple with equal size
.SH SYNOPSIS
dirsplit \fB[options]\fR < directory | content-list-file >
.SH DESCRIPTION
displit is designed to for a simple purpose: convert a directory with
many multiple files (which are all smaller than a certain medium, eg.
DVD) and "splits" it into "volumes", looking for the optimal order to
get the best space/medium-number efficiency.
.P
The actual action is either adding the files to mkisofs catalogs or real
moving of files into new directories (or creating links/symlinks).
The method is not limited to files, whole directories can also be handled this
way (see various filesystem exploration modes).
